      <t>This document describes how to use IP-based emergency services mechanisms to support the next generation of the Pan European in-vehicle emergency call service defined under the eSafety initiative of the European Commission (generally referred to as "eCall"). eCall is a standardized and mandated system for a special form of emergency calls placed by vehicles.  eCall deployment is required by 2015 in European Union member states, and eCall (and eCall-compatible systems) are also being deployed in other regions.  eCall provides an integrated voice path and a standardized set of vehicle, sensor (e.g., crash related), and location data.  An eCall is recognized and handled as a specialized form of emergency call and is routed to a specialized eCall-capable Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) capable of processing the vehicle data and trained in handling emergency calls from vehicles.</t>

      <t>Currently, eCall functions over circuit-switched cellular telephony; work on next-generation eCall (NG-eCall, sometimes called packet-switched eCall or PS-eCall) is now in process, and this document assists in that work by describing how to support eCall within the IP-based emergency services infrastructure.</t>

      <t>This document also registers a MIME Content Type and an Emergency Call Additional Data Block for the eCall vehicle data.</t>

<section anchor="scope" title="Document Scope">
        <t>This document is limited to the signaling, data exchange, and protocol needs of next-generation eCall (NG-eCall, also referred to as packet-switched eCall (PS-eCall) and all-IP eCall).  eCall itself is specified by 3GPP and CEN and these specifications include far greater scope than is covered here.</t>
        <t>The eCall service operates over cellular wireless communication, but this document does not address cellular-specific details, nor client domain selection (e.g., circuit-switched versus packet-switched).  All such aspects are the purview of their respective standards bodies.  The scope of this document is limited to eCall operating within a SIP-based environment, such as 3GPP IMS Emergency Calling.</t>

    <t>Vehicles designed for multiple regions may need to support eCall and other Advanced Automatic Crash Notification systems, such as described in <xref target="draft-ietf-ecrit-car-crash"/>.  That system is compatible with eCall in most respects, differing primarily in the Request-URI and the specific data block that is sent.</t>
    </section> <!-- anchor="scope" -->


<section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">

      <t>Emergency calls made from vehicles (e.g., in the event of a crash) assist in significantly reducing
        road deaths and injuries by allowing emergency services to be aware of the incident, the state of the vehicle, the location of the vehicle, and to have a voice channel with the vehicle occupants.  This enables a quick and appropriate response.</t>
        
        <t>The European Commission initiative of eCall was conceived in the late 1990s, and has evolved to a European Parliament decision requiring the implementation of compliant in-vehicle systems (IVS) in new vehicles and the deployment of eCall in the European Member States in 2015.  eCall (and eCall-compatible systems) are also being adopted in other regions.</t>
        
        <t>The pan-European eCall system provides a standardized and mandated mechanism for emergency calls by vehicles.  eCall establishes procedures for such calls to be placed by in-vehicle systems, recognized and processed by the network, and routed to a specialized PSAP where the vehicle data is available to assist the call taker in assessing and responding to the situation.  eCall provides a standard set of vehicle, sensor (e.g., crash related), and location data.</t>

      <t>An eCall may be either user-initiated or automatically triggered.  Automatically triggered eCalls indicate a car crash or some other serious incident (e.g., a fire)  and carry a greater presumption of risk of injury.  Manually triggered eCalls may be reports of serious hazards and are likely to require a different response than an automatically triggered eCall.  Manually triggered eCalls are also more likely to be false (e.g., accidental) calls and may thus be subject to different handling by the PSAP.</t>

    <t>Currently, eCall is standardized (by 3GPP <xref target="SDO-3GPP" /> and CEN <xref target="CEN" />) as a 3GPP circuit-switched call  over GSM (2G) or UMTS (3G).  Flags in the call setup mark the call as an eCall, and further indicate if the call was automatically or manually triggered.  The call is routed to an eCall-capable PSAP, a voice channel is established between the vehicle and the PSAP, and an eCall in-band modem is used to carry a defined set of vehicle, sensor (e.g., crash related), and location data (the Minimum Set of Data or MSD) within the voice channel.  The same in-band mechanism is used for the PSAP to acknowledge successful receipt of the MSD, and to request the vehicle to send a new MSD (e.g., to check if the state of or location of the vehicle or its occupants has changed).  Work on next-generation eCall (NG-eCall, also referred to as packet-switched eCall or PS eCall) is now in process.  As part of this work, the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) <xref target="SDO-ETSI" /> has published a Technical Report titled "Mobile Standards Group (MSG); eCall for VoIP" <xref target="MSG_TR" /> that presents findings and recommendations regarding support for eCall in an all-IP environment.  NG-eCall moves from circuit switched to all-IP, and carries the vehicle data and other eCall-specific data as additional data associated with the call.  This document describes how IETF mechanisms for IP-based emergency calls, including <xref target="RFC6443"/> and <xref target="additional-data-draft"/> are used to provide the signaling and data exchange of the next generation of pan-European eCall.</t>
    
    <t>NG-eCall is a 3GPP IMS emergency call with additional elements identifying the call as an eCall and as carrying eCall data and with mechanisms for carrying the data.  3GPP IMS emergency services support multimedia, providing the ability to carry voice, text, and video.  This capability is referred to within 3GPP as Multimedia Emergency Services (MMES).</t>

    <t>A transition period will exist during which time the various entities involved in initiating and handling an eCall might support next-generation eCall, legacy eCall, or both.  This transition period might last several years or longer.  The issue of migration/co-existence during the transition period is very important but is outside the scope of this document.  The ETSI TR "Mobile Standards Group (MSG); eCall for VoIP" <xref target="MSG_TR" /> discusses these issues in Clause 7.</t>

<section anchor="requirements" title="eCall Requirements">

    
    <t>Overall eCall requirements are specified by by by CEN in <xref target="EN_16072" /> and by 3GPP in <xref target="TS22.101" /> clauses 10.7 and A.27.  Requirements specific to vehicle data are contained in EN 15722 <xref target="msd"/>.  For convenience, the requirements most applicable to the limited scope of this document are summarized very briefly below.</t>
    <t>eCall requires:

        <?rfc subcompact="yes"?>
        <list style="symbols">

            <t>The call be recognized as an eCall (which is inherently an emergency call)</t>

            <t>A voice channel between the vehicle and the PSAP</t>
            <t>Carrying the MSD intrinsically with the call (the MSD needs to be available to the same call-taker as the voice)</t>
            <t>The ability for the PSAP to acknowledge receipt of the MSD</t>
            <t>The ability for the PSAP to request that the vehicle generate and transmit a new MSD</t>
            <t>The ability of the PSAP to be able to re-contact the occupants of vehicle after the initial eCall is concluded</t>
            <t>The ability to perform a test call (which may be routed to a PSAP but is not treated as an emergency call and not handled by a call taker)</t>

            <t>The ability to handle text</t>
            <t>The ability for the PSAP to access vehicle components (e.g., an onboard camera (such as rear facing or blind-spot cameras) for a visual assessment of the crash site situation)</t>

<section anchor="data" title="Vehicle Data">

<t>Pan-European eCall provides a standardized and mandated set of vehicle related data, known as the Minimum Set of Data (MSD). The European Committee for Standardization (CEN) has specified this data in EN 15722 <xref target="msd"/>, along with both ASN.1 and XML encodings for the MSD <xref target="msd"/>.  Circuit-switched eCall uses the ASN.1 encoding.  The XML encoding is better suited for use in SIP messages and is used in this document.  (The ASN.1 encoding is specified in Annex A of EN 15722 <xref target="msd"/>, while the XML encoding is specified in Annex C.)</t>

<t>The "Additional Data related to an Emergency Call" document <xref target="additional-data-draft"/> establishes a general mechanism for attaching blocks of data to a SIP emergency call.  This document makes use of that mechanism to carry the eCall MSD in a SIP emergency call.</t>

<t>This document registers the 'application/emergencyCallData.eCall.MSD+xml' MIME Content-Type to enable the MSD to be carried in SIP.  This document also adds the 'eCall.MSD' entry to the Emergency Call Additional Data Blocks registry (established by <xref target="additional-data-draft"/>) to enable the MSD to be recognized as such in a SIP-based eCall emergency call.</t>

<!-- 
<t>Should CEN and/or other entities choose to define supplemental or updated sets of data, the steps to enable each data block are very briefly summarized below:

<section anchor="setup" title="Call Setup">

<t>In circuit-switched eCall, the IVS places a special form of a 112 emergency call which carries the eCall flag (indicating that the call is an eCall and also if the call was manually or automatically triggered); the mobile network operator (MNO) recognizes the eCall flag and routes the call to an eCall-capable PSAP; vehicle data is transmitted to the PSAP via the eCall in-band
modem (in the voice channel).</t>

        </figure>
      </t>

<t>An In-Vehicle System (IVS) which supports NG-eCall transmits the MSD in accordance with <xref target="additional-data-draft"/> by encoding it as specified (per Appendix C of EN 15722 <xref target="msd"/>) and attaching it to an INVITE as a MIME body part. The body part is identified by its MIME content-type ('application/emergencyCallData.eCall.MSD+xml') in the Content-Type header field of the body part.  The body part is assigned a unique identifier which is listed in a Content-ID header field in the body part.  The INVITE is marked as containing the MSD by adding (or appending to) a Call-Info header field at the top level of the INVITE.  This Call-Info header field contains a CID URL referencing the body part's unique identifier, and a 'purpose' parameter identifying the data as the eCall MSD per the registry entry; the 'purpose' parameter's value is 'emergencyCallData.' and the root of the MIME type (not including the
   'emergencyCallData' prefix and any suffix such as '+xml' (e.g., 'purpose=emergencyCallData.eCall.MSD').</t>

<t>For NG-eCall, the IVS establishes an emergency call using the 3GPP IMS solution with a Request-URI indicating an eCall type of emergency call and with vehicle data attached; the MNO or ESInet recognizes the eCall URN and routes the call to a NG-eCall capable PSAP; the PSAP interpets the vehicle data sent with the call and makes it available to the call taker.</t>

   <t>This document registers new service URN children within the "sos" subservice.  These URNs provide the mechanism by which an eCall is identified, and differentiate between manually and automatically triggered eCalls (which may be subject to different treatment, depending on policy). The two service URNs are: urn:service:sos.ecall.automatic and urn:service:sos.ecall.manual</t>

    </section> <!-- title="Call Setup" -->

<section anchor="routing" title="Call Routing">

    <t>The routing rules for eCalls are likely to differ from those of other emergency calls because eCalls are special types of emergency calls (with implications for the types of response required) and need to be handled by specially designated PSAPs.  In an environment that uses ESInets, the originating network passes all types of emergency calls to an ESInet (which have a request URI containing the "SOS" service URN).  The ESInet is then responsible for routing such calls to the appropriate PSAP.  In an environment without an ESInet, the emergency services authorities and the originating network jointly determine how such calls are routed.</t>

    <section anchor="esinets" title="ESInets">
    <t>This section provides background information on ESInets for information only.</t>
    
    <t>An Emergency Services IP Network (ESInet) is a network operated by emergency services authorities.  It handles emergency call routing and processing before delivery to a PSAP.  In the NG1-1-2 architecture adopted by EENA, each PSAP is connected to one or more ESInets.  Each originating network is also connected to one or more ESInets.  The ESInets maintain policy-based routing rules which control the routing and processing of emergency calls.  The centralization of such rules within ESInets provides for a cleaner separation between the responsibilities of the originating network and that of the emergency services network, and provides greater flexibility and control over processing of emergency calls by the emergency services authorities.  This makes it easier to react quickly to unusual situations that require changes in how emergency calls are routed or handled (e.g., a natural disaster closes a PSAP), as well as ease in making long-term changes that affect such routing (e.g., cooperative agreements to specially handle calls requiring translation or relay services).  ESInets may support the ability to interwork NG-eCall to legacy eCall to handle eCall-capable PSAPs that are not IP PSAPs (similarly to the ability to interwork IP emergency calls to legacy non-IP PSAPs).  Note that in order to support legacy eCall-capable PSAPs that are not IP PSAPs and are not attached to an ESInet, an originating network may need the ability to route an eCall itself (e.g., to an interworking facility with interconnection to a suitable legacy eCall capable PSAP) based on the eCall and manual or automatic indications.  The ETSI TR "Mobile Standards Group (MSG); eCall for VoIP" <xref target="MSG_TR" /> discusses transition issues in Clause 7.</t>
    </section> <!-- title="ESInets" -->

</section> <!-- title="Call Routing" -->

<section anchor="test-calls" title="Test Calls">

   <t>eCall requires the ability to place test calls.  These are calls that are recognized and treated to some extent as eCalls but are not given emergency call treatment and are not handled by call takers.  The test call facility allows the IVS or user to verify that an eCall can be successfully established with voice communication.  The IVS can also verify that the MSD was successfully received.</t>
   
   <t>A service URN starting with "test." indicates a test call.  For eCall,
   "urn:service:test.sos.ecall" indicates such a test feature. This functionality is defined in <xref target="RFC6881"/>.</t>
   
   <t>This document registers "urn:service:test.sos.ecall" for eCall test calls.</t>
   
   <t>the current eCall test call facility is a non-emergency number so does not get treated as an emergency call.  MNOs may treat a vehicle call in the "test" service URN in a way that tests as much functionality as desired, but this is outside the scope of this document.</t>
   
   <t>PSAPs that have the ability to process NG-eCalls SHOULD accept test calls and send an acknowledgment if the MSD was successfully received, per this document.  Such PSAPs MAY also play an audio clip (for example, saying that the call reached a PSAP) in addition to supporting media loopback per <xref target="RFC6881"/>.</t>

</section> <!-- title="Test Calls" -->


<section anchor="metadata" title="eCall-Specific Control/Metadata">
    
    <t>eCall requires the ability for the PSAP to acknowledge successful receipt of an MSD sent by the IVS, and for the PSAP to request that the IVS send an MSD (e.g., the call taker may initiate a request for a new MSD to see if the vehicle's state or location has changed).  Future enhancements are desired to enable the PSAP to send other requests to the vehicle, such as locking or unlocking doors, sounding the horn, flashing the lights, starting a video stream from on-board cameras (such as rear focus or blind-spot), etc.</t>

    <t>The mechanism established in <xref target="additional-data-draft"/>, used in <xref target="data" /> of this document to carry the MSD from the IVS to the PSAP, is also used to carry a block of control data from the PSAP to the IVS.  This eCall control block (sometimes referred to as eCall metadata) is an XML structure containing eCall-specific elements.  When the PSAP needs to send an eCall control block that is in response to the MSD or other data sent by the IVS in a SIP request, the control block can be sent in the SIP response to that request (e.g., the INVITE).  When the PSAP needs to send an eCall control block that is not an immediate response to an MSD or other data sent by the IVS, the control block can be transmitted from the PSAP to the IVS in a SIP INFO message within the established session.  The IVS can then send any requested data (such as a new MSD) in the reply to the INFO message. This mechanism flexibly allows the PSAP to send eCall-specific data to the IVS and the IVS to respond.  If control data sent in a response message requests the IVS to send a new MSD or other data block, the IVS can do so in an INFO message within the session (it could also use re-INVITE but that is unnecessary when no aspect of the session or media is changing).</t>

        The 'ack' element is transmitted by the PSAP to acknowledge receipt of an eCall data object.  An 'ack' element sent by a PSAP references the unique ID of the data object that was sent by the IVS, and further indicates if the PSAP considers the receipt successful or not.  The 'ack' element is also transmitted by the IVS to the PSAP to acknowledge receipt of a 'request' element that requested the IVS to perform an action other than transmitting a data object (e.g., a request to display a message would be acknowledged, but a request to transmit a data object would not result in a separate 'ack' element being sent, since the data object itself serves as acknowledgment.)  An 'ack' element sent by an IVS references the unique ID of the request being acknowledged, and further indicates whether the request was successfully performed.

    <section anchor="info" title="The emergencyCallData.eCall INFO package">
    <t>
    This document registers the 'emergencyCallData.eCall' INFO package.
    
    Both endpoints (the IVS and the PSAP equipment) set the Recv-Info header field to 'emergencyCallData.eCall' per <xref target="RFC6086"/> to indicate ability to receive INFO messages carrying eCall data or control blocks.
    </t>
    
    <t>
    Support for the 'emergencyCallData.eCall' INFO package indicates the ability to receive eCall data and control blocks, which are carried in a body part whose subtype starts with 'emergencyCallData.eCall.'.  At present there is only one defined eCall data block, which has the 'application/emergencyCallData.eCall.MSD+xml' MIME type, and one eCall control block, which has the 'application/emergencyCallData.eCall.control+xml' MIME type.  The eCall control block includes the ability for the IVS to indicate its capabilities, so in the event additional eCall blocks are defined, the IVS can indicate which it supports. 
    </t>
    
    <t>The use of INFO is based on an analysis of the requirements against the intent and effects of INFO versus other approaches (such as SIP MESSAGE, media plane, or non-SIP protocols).  In particular, the transport of eCall data and control blocks is done only during an emergency session established with SIP, using the mechanism established in <xref target="additional-data-draft"/>, and is normally carried in the initial INVITE and its response; the use of INFO only occurs when a data block or request needs to be sent subsequently during the call.  While MESSAGE could be used, it is not tied to a SIP session as is INFO.  REINVITE could also be used, but is normally used to modify the session.  SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY could be coerced into service, but the semantics are not a clean fit.  Hence, INFO is appropriate.
    </t>
    <t>An INFO request message carrying an eCall data or control block has an Info-Package header field set to 'emergencyCallData.eCall' per <xref target="RFC6086"/>.  The INFO request message is marked as containing the eCall data or control block by a Call-Info header field containing a CID URL referencing the unique identifier of the body part containing the eCall data or control, and a 'purpose' parameter identifying the block.  Because the eCall data or control block is being carried in an INFO request message, the body part also carries a Content-Disposition header field set to "Info-Package".
    </t>
    
    <t>
    Per <xref target="additional-data-draft"/>, emergency call related additional data MAY be included in any SIP message.  Hence, notwithstanding Section 4.3.2. of <xref target="RFC6086"/>, INFO response messages MAY contain eCall data or control blocks, provided they are included as described in this document (with a Call-Info header field containing a CID URL referencing the unique identifier of the body part, and a 'purpose' parameter identifying the block).  When eCall data or control blocks are included in an INFO response message, this is done per <xref target="additional-data-draft"/> and this document, and not under <xref target="RFC6086"/>; that is, they are included as emergency call additional data, not as an INFO package associated data.

<section anchor="example" title="Examples">
    <t>
        <xref target="fig1"/> shows an eCall. The call uses the request URI 'urn:service:sos.ecall.automatic' service URN and is
        recognized as an eCall, and further as one that was invoked automatically by the IVS due to a crash or other serious incident.  In this example, the originating network routes the call to an ESInet (as for any emergency call in an environment with an ESInet).  The ESInet routes the call to the appropriate NG-eCall capable PSAP.
        The emergency call is received by the ESInet's Emergency Services Routing Proxy (ESRP), as the entry point into
        the ESInet. The ESRP routes the call to a PSAP, where it is received by a call taker.
        In deployments where there is no ESInet, the originating network routes the call directly to the appropriate NG-eCall capable PSAP.

<section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>The security considerations described in <xref target="RFC5069"/> apply here.</t>
       
      <t>An eCall will carry two forms of location data: the network-provided location that is inherently part of IMS emergency calls (which might be determined solely by the network, or in cooperation with or possibly entirely by the originating device), and the IVS-supplied location within the MSD.  This is likely to be useful to the PSAP, especially when the two locations are independently determined.  Even in situations where the network-supplied location is limited to the cell site, this can be useful as a sanity check on the device-supplied location contained in the MSD.</t>
      
      <t>The document <xref target="I-D.ietf-ecrit-trustworthy-location"/> discusses trust issues regarding location provided by or determined in cooperation with end devices.</t>
      
      <t>The mechanism by which the PSAP sends acknowledgments and requests to the vehicle requires authenticity considerations; when the PSAP request is received within a session initiated by the vehicle as an eCall emergency call placed over a cellular network, there is a higher degree of trust that the source is indeed a PSAP.  If the PSAP request is received in other situations, such as a call-back, the trust issues in verifying that a call-back is indeed from a PSAP are more complex (see the PSAP Callback document <xref target="RFC7090"/>).  A further safeguard (applicable regardless of which end initiated the call and the means of the call) is for the PSAP or emergency service provider to sign the body part using a certificate issued by a known emergency services certificate authority and for which the IVS can verify the root certificate.</t>

							</t>

							<t>Security considerations:

    This content type carries metadata and control information and requests, primarily from a Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) to an In-Vehicle System (IVS) during an emergency call, and also capabilities from the IVS to the PSAP.

    Metadata (such as an acknowledgment that data sent by the IVS to the PSAP was successfully received) has limited privacy and security implications.  Control information (such as requests from the PSAP that the vehicle perform an action) has some privacy and important security implications.  The privacy concern arises from the ability to request the vehicle to transmit a data set, which as described in <xref target="MSD.MIME" />, may contain personal information.  The security implication is the ability to request the vehicle to perform an action.  It is important that control information originate only from a PSAP or other emergency services provider, and not from an impostor.  The first safeguard for this is the security of the cellular network over which the emergency call was placed.  In particular, when the IVS initiates an eCall over a cellular network, the MNO routes the call to a PSAP.  (Calls placed using other means, such as Wi-Fi or over-the-top services, do not carry the same degree of trust.)  Calls received by the IVS, such as a call-back from a PSAP, also do not carry the same degree of trust, since the current mechanisms are not ideal for verifying that such a call is indeed from a PSAP in response to an emergency call placed by the IVS.  See the discussion in <xref target="security" /> and the PSAP Callback document <xref target="RFC7090"/>.  A further safeguard, and one applicable regardless of which end initiated the call and the means of the call, is for the PSAP or emergency service provider to sign the body part using a certificate issued by a known emergency services certificate authority and for which the IVS can verify the root certificate.

        <t>When new messages are added to the registry, the message text is determined by the registrant; IANA assigns the IDs.  Each message is assigned a consecutive integer value as its ID.  This allows an IVS to indicate by a single integer value that it supports all messages with that value or lower.</t>

        <abstract>
        <t>
        This document describes how to use IP-based emergency services mechanisms to support the next generation of emergency calls placed by vehicles (automatically in the event of a crash or serious incident, or manually invoked by a vehicle occupant) and conveying vehicle, sensor, and location data related to the crash or incident. Such calls are often referred to as "Automatic Crash Notification" (ACN), or "Advanced Automatic Crash Notification" (AACN), even in the case of manual trigger. The "Advanced" qualifier refers to the ability to carry a richer set of data. This document also registers a MIME Content Type and an Emergency Call Additional Data Block for the vehicle, sensor, and location data (often referred to as "crash data" even though there is not necessarily a crash). Profiling and simplifications are possible due to the nature of the functionality that is provided in vehicles with the usage of Global Satellite Navigation System (GNSS).
