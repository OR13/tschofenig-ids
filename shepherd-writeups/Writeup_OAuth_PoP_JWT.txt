Shepherd Writeup for "Proof-of-Possession Key Semantics for JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)"
draft-ietf-oauth-proof-of-possession-04

1. Summary

The document shepherd is Kepeng Li. The responsible Area Director is
Kathleen Moriarty.

   This specification defines how to express a declaration in a JSON Web
   Token (JWT) that the presenter of the JWT possesses a particular key
   and that the recipient can cryptographically confirm proof-of-
   possession of the key by the presenter.  This property is also
   sometimes described as the presenter being a holder-of-key.


This specification is a Standards Track RFC describing a solution 
component described in the OAuth 2.0 Proof-of-Possession architecture 
(see draft-ietf-oauth-pop-architecture). 

2. Review and Consensus

The document was developed by the working group based on the 
requirements and architecture described in draft-ietf-oauth-pop-architecture. 
There is strong consensus behind this work. 

This document contains an IANA consideration section and requires
