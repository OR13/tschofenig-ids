1.  Introduction

   The CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) message structure uses
   references to keys and defines header parameters to carry chains of
   X.509 certificates.  The header parameters for conveying X.509
   certificate chains in a COSE payload are defined in [RFC9360].  This
   document is inspired by RFC 9360 and re-uses text as much as possible
   and is intentionally aligned.

   This specification defines header parameters to convey chains of CBOR
   Web Tokens (CWTs) [RFC8392].  The use of chains of CWTs allows a
   trust infrastructure established by CWTs to be used with COSE.  The
   Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) key structures [RFC8949]
   that have been defined in COSE support the use of X.509 certificates.
   While there is a lot of X.509 infrastructure and protocol support
   available, CWTs are used in environments successfully.

   These chains of CWTs allow path validation similarly to what a X.509
   certificate-based Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) provides.  Applying
   PKI-based concepts is new to CWTs, new terminology is introduced.
   Path validation is an important part of establishing trust in a CWT
   and Section 6 of [RFC5280] provides guidance.  When applying path

   validation, as defined in RFC 5280, to CWTs the reader needs to treat
   them as certificates, assuming CWTs also carry a public key -- see
   [RFC8747].  Keep in mind that many of the advanced features available
   with an X.509 certificate-based PKI are, at the time of writing, not
   available with CWTs.  The authors do, however, believe differences
   will vanish as CWT-based deployments scale.

2.  Terminology and Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   The following terms are useful for readers of this document:

   *  end entity: user of CWT and/or end user system that is the subject
      of a CWT;

   *  CA: certification authority; often corresponds to an authorization
      server in the context of CWTs.

   *  RA: registration authority, i.e., an optional system to which a CA
      delegates certain management functions; while often used in PKI
      deployments it is a role that has not found usage in systems using
      CWTs.

   *  CRL issuer: a system that generates and signs Certificate
      Revocation Lists (CRLs); The term CRL is used generically to also
      refer to status lists [I-D.ietf-oauth-status-list].

   *  repository: a system or collection of distributed systems that
      stores CWTs and CRLs and serves as a means of distributing these
      CWTs and CRLs to end entities.  These repositories may be append-
      only databases, in the style of
      [I-D.mcmillion-keytrans-architecture].

3.  CWT COSE Header Parameters

   Parties that intend to rely on the assertions made by a CWTs obtained
   from any of these methods still need to validate it.  This validation
   can be done according to the PKIX rules specified in [RFC5280] or by
   using a different trust structure, such as a trusted distributor for
   self-signed CWTs.  The PKIX validation includes matching against the
   trust anchors configured for the application.  These rules apply when
   the validation succeeds in a single step as well as when CWT chains
   need to be built.  If the application cannot establish trust in the
   CWT, the public key contained in the CWT cannot be used for
   cryptographic operations.

Internet-Draft                 CWT Chains                  December 2023


   The header parameters defined in this document are as follows:

   cwt-bag: This header parameter contains a bag of CWTs, which is
   unordered and may contain self-signed CWTs.  Note that there could be
   duplicate CWTs.  The CWT bag can contain CWT that are completely
   extraneous to the message.  (An example of this would be where a
   signed message is being used to transport a CWT containing a key
   agreement key.)  As the CWT are unordered, the party evaluating the
   signature will need to be capable of building the CWT path as
   necessary.  That party will also have to take into account that the
   bag may not contain the full set of CWT needed to build any
   particular chain.

   The trust mechanism MUST process any CWT in this
   parameter as untrusted input.  The presence of a self-signed
   CWT in the parameter MUST NOT cause the update of the set
   of trust anchors without some out-of-band confirmation.  As the
   contents of this header parameter are untrusted input, the header
   parameter can be in either the protected or unprotected header
   bucket.  Sending the header parameter in the unprotected header
   bucket allows an intermediary to remove or add CWT.

   The end-entity CWT MUST be integrity protected by COSE.
   This can, for example, be done by sending the header parameter in
   the protected header, sending an 'cwt-bag' in the unprotected header
   combined with an 'cwt-t' in the protected header, or including the
   end-entity CWT in the external_aad.

   This header parameter allows for a single CWT or a
   bag of CWT to be carried in the message.

   *  If a single CWT is conveyed, it is placed in a CBOR
       byte string.

   *  If multiple CWTs are conveyed, a CBOR array of byte
       strings is used, with each CWT being in its own byte
       string.

   cwt-chain: This header parameter contains an ordered array of CWTs.
   The CWTs are to be ordered starting with the CWT containing the end-
   entity key followed by the CWT that signed it, and so on.  There is
   no requirement for the entire chain to be present in the element if
   there is reason to believe that the relying party already has, or can
   locate, the missing CWT.  This means that the relying party is still
   required to do path building but that a candidate path is proposed in
   this header parameter.

   The trust mechanism MUST process any CWT in this
   parameter as untrusted input.  The presence of a self-signed
   CWT in the parameter MUST NOT cause the update of the set
   of trust anchors without some out-of-band confirmation.  As the
   contents of this header parameter are untrusted input, the header
   parameter can be in either the protected or unprotected header
   bucket.  Sending the header parameter in the unprotected header
   bucket allows an intermediary to remove or add CWT.

   The end-entity CWT MUST be integrity protected by COSE.
   This can, for example, be done by sending the header parameter in
   the protected header, sending an 'cwt-chain' in the unprotected
   header combined with an 'cwt-t' in the protected header, or
   including the end-entity CWT in the external_aad.

   This header parameter allows for a single CWT or a
   chain of CWTs to be carried in the message.

   *  If a single CWT is conveyed, it is placed in a CBOR
       byte string.

   *  If multiple CWTs are conveyed, a CBOR array of byte
       strings is used, with each CWT being in its own byte
       string.

   cwt-t: This header parameter identifies the end-entity CWT by a hash
   value (a thumbprint).  The 'cwt-t' header parameter is represented as
   an array of two elements.  The first element is an algorithm
   identifier that is an integer or a string containing the hash
   algorithm identifier corresponding to the Value column (integer or
   text string) of the algorithm registered in the "COSE Algorithms"
   registry (see [COSE-IANA]).  The second element is a binary string
   containing the hash value computed over the CWT.

   As this header parameter does not provide any trust, the header
   parameter can be in either a protected or unprotected header
   bucket.

   The identification of the end-entity CWT MUST be integrity
   protected by COSE.  This can be done by sending the header
   parameter in the protected header or including the end-entity
   CWT in the external_aad.

   The 'cwt-t' header parameter can be used alone or together with the
   'cwt-bag', 'cwt-chain', or 'cwt-u' header parameters to provide
   integrity protection of the end-entity CWT.

   For interoperability, applications that use this header parameter
   MUST support the hash algorithm 'SHA-256' but can use other hash
   algorithms.  This requirement allows for different implementations
   to be configured to use an interoperable algorithm, but does not
   preclude the use (by prior agreement) of other algorithms.

   Note: For conveying the thumbprint of a public key alone, see
   {{I-D.ietf-cose-key-thumbprint}}.

   cwt-u: This header parameter provides the ability to identify a CWT
   by a URI [RFC3986].  It contains a CBOR text string.  The referenced
   resource can be any of the following media types:

   *  application/cwt {{RFC8392}}

   *  application/cwt usage=chain (see {{chain}})

   When the application/cwt media type is used, the data is a
   encoded according to RFC 8392.  If the parameter "usage" is
   set to "chain", this sequence indicates a CWT chain.

   The end-entity CWT MUST be integrity protected by COSE.
   This can, for example, be done by sending the 'cwt-u' in the
   unprotected or protected header combined with an 'cwt-t' in the
   protected header, or including the end-entity CWT in the
   external_aad.  As the end-entity CWT is integrity
   protected by COSE, the URI does not need to provide any
   protection.

   If a retrieved CWT does not chain to an existing trust
   anchor, that CWT MUST NOT be trusted unless the URI
   provides integrity protection and server authentication and the
   server is configured as trusted to provide new trust anchors or if
   an out-of-band confirmation can be received for trusting the
   retrieved CWT.  If an HTTP or Constrained Application
   Protocol (CoAP) GET request is used to retrieve a CWT, a
   standardized security protocol should be used. Examples of such
   security protocols include TLS
   {{RFC8446}}, DTLS {{RFC9147}}, or Object Security for Constrained
   RESTful Environments (OSCORE) {{RFC8613}} should be used.

   The header parameters are used in the following locations:

   COSE_Signature and COSE_Sign1 objects: In these objects, the
   parameters identify the CWT to be used for validating the signature.

   COSE_recipient objects: In this location, the parameters identify the
   CWT for the recipient of the message.

   The labels assigned to each header parameter can be found in
   Figure 1.

   Below is an equivalent Concise Data Definition Language (CDDL)
   description (see [RFC8610]) of the text above.

   COSE_CWT = CWT-Messages / [ 2*CWT-Messages ]
   COSE_CWTHash = [ hashAlg: (int / tstr), hashValue: bstr ]

   The contents of "bstr" are the bytes of a CWT.

4.  CWTs and Static-Static ECDH

   The header parameters defined in the previous section are used to
   identify the recipient CWT.  In this section, we define the
   algorithm-specific parameters that are used for identifying or
   transporting the sender's key for static-static key agreement
   algorithms.

   These attributes are defined analogously to those in the previous
   section.  There is no definition for the CWT bag, as the same
   parameter would be used for both the sender and recipient.

   cwt-chain-sender: This header parameter contains the chain of CWT
   starting with the sender's key exchange CWT.  The structure is the
   same as 'cwt-chain'.

   cwt-t-sender: This header parameter contains the hash value for the
   sender's key exchange CWT.  The structure is the same as 'cwt-t'.

   cwt-u-sender: This header parameter contains a URI for the sender's
   key exchange CWT.  The structure and processing are the same as 'cwt-
   u'.

5.  Security Considerations

   Establishing trust in a CWT is a vital part of processing.  A major
   component of establishing trust is determining what the set of trust
   anchors are for the process.  A new self-signed CWT appearing on the
   client cannot be a trigger to modify the set of trust anchors,
   because a well-defined trust-establishment process is required.  One
   common way for a new trust anchor to be added to (or removed from) a
   device is by doing a new firmware upgrade.

   In constrained systems, there is a trade-off between the order of
   checking the signature and checking the CWT for validity.  Validating
   CWTs may require that network resources be accessed in order to get
   statys information or retrieve CWTs during path building.  The
   resulting network access can consume power and network bandwidth.  On
   the other hand, if the CWT are validated after the signature is
   validated, an oracle can potentially be built based on detecting the
   network resources, which is only done if the signature validation
   passes.  In any event, both the signature validation and the CWT
   validation MUST be completed successfully before acting on any
   requests.

Internet-Draft                 CWT Chains                  December 2023


   The end-entity CWT MUST be integrity protected by COSE.  Without
   proof of possession, an attacker can trick the CA into issuing an
   identity-misbinding CWT with someone else's "borrowed" public key but
   with a different subject.  An on-path attacker can then perform an
   identity-misbinding attack by replacing the real end-entity CWT in
   COSE with such an identity- misbinding CWT.

   End-entity CWTs contain identities that a passive on-path attacker
   eavesdropping on the conversation can use to identify and track the
   subject.  To provide identity protection,COSE can be sent inside
   another security protocol providing confidentiality.  The 'cwt-t' and
   'cwt-u' header parameters are just alternative permanent identifiers
   and can also be used to track the subject.

   Before using the key in a CWT, the key MUST be checked against the
   algorithm to be used, and any algorithm-specific checks need to be
   made.  These checks can include validating that points are on curves
   for elliptical curve algorithms and that the sizes of RSA keys are
   within an acceptable range.  The use of unvalidated keys can lead to
   either loss of security or excessive consumption of resources (for
   example, using a 200K RSA key).

   When processing the 'cwt-u' header parameter, the security
   considerations of [RFC3986], and specifically those defined in
   Section 7.1 of [RFC3986], also apply.

   Protecting the integrity of the 'cwt-bag', 'cwt-chain', and 'cwt-t'
   contents by placing them in the protected header bucket can help
   mitigate some risks of a misbehaving CA (cf.  Section 5.1 of
   [RFC2634]).

   The security of the algorithm used for 'cwt-t' does not affect the
   security of the system, as this header parameter selects which CWT
   that is already present on the system should be used, but it does not
   provide any trust.

6.  IANA Considerations

6.1.  COSE Header Parameters Registry

   IANA has registered the new COSE Header parameters in Figure 1 in the
   "COSE Header Parameters" registry.  The "Value Registry" field is
   empty for all of the items.  For each item, the "Reference" field
   points to this document.

6.2.  COSE Header Algorithm Parameters Registry

   IANA has registered the new COSE Header Algorithm parameters in
   Figure 2 in the "COSE Header Algorithm Parameters" registry.  For
   each item, the "Reference" field points to this document.

6.3.  Media Type application/cwt

   When the application/cwt media type is used, the data is a CBOR
   sequence of single-entry COSE_CWT structures (encoding "bstr").  If
   the parameter "usage" is set to "chain", this sequence indicates a
   CWT chain.

   The application/cwt media type is already registered by [RFC8392] and
   this document updates the IANA entry of this media type [RFC6838]:

   *  Type name: application

   *  Subtype name: cwt
