Nonce-based Freshness for Attestation in Certification Requests for use
               with the Certification Management Protocol
                draft-tschofenig-lamps-nonce-for-cmp-00

Abstract

   Certificate Management Protocol (CMP) defines protocol messages for
   X.509v3 certificate creation and management.  CMP provides
   interactions between client systems and PKI components, such as a
   Registration Authority (RA) and a Certification Authority (CA).

   CMP allows an RA/CA to inform an end entity about the information it
   has to provide in a certification request.  When an end entity places
   attestation information in form of evidence in a certification
   signing request (CSR) it may need to demonstrate freshness of the
   provided evidence.  Attestation technology today often accomplishes
   this task via the help of nonces.  This document specifies how nonces
   are provided by an RA/CA to the end entity for inclusion in evidence.

1.  Introduction

   Certificate Management Protocol (CMP) [I-D.ietf-lamps-rfc4210bis]
   defines protocol messages for X.509v3 certificate creation and
   management.  CMP provides interactions between client systems and PKI
   components, such as a Registration Authority (RA) and a Certification
   Authority (CA).

   CMP allows an RA/CA to inform an end entity about the information it
   has to provide in a certification request.  When an end entity places
   attestation information in form of evidence in a certification
   signing request (CSR) it may need to demonstrate freshness of the
   provided evidence.  Such an attestation extension to a CSR is
   described in [I-D.ounsworth-csr-attestation].  Attestation technology
   today, such as [TPM20] and [I-D.tschofenig-rats-psa-token], often
   accomplishes this task via the help of nonces.  A discussion of
   freshness approaches for evidence is found in Section 10 of
   [RFC9334].

   For an end entity to include a nonce in the evidence (by the
   attester) it is necessary to obtain this nonce from the relying
   party, i.e. RA/CA in our use case, first.  Since the CSR itself is a
   'one-shot' message the CMP protocol is used to obtain the nonce from
   the RA/CA.  CMP already offers a mechanism to request information
   from the RA/CA prior to a certification request.  This document uses
   the CertReqTemplate described in Section 5.3.19.16 of

   [I-D.ietf-lamps-rfc4210bis].  Once the nonce is obtained the end
   entity can issue an API call to the attester to request evidence and
   passes the nonce as an input parameter into the API call.  The
   returned evidence is then embedded into a CSR and returned to the RA/
   CA in a certification request message.

   This exchange is shown graphically below.

2.  Terminology and Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   The terms attester, relying party, verifier and evidence are defined
   in [RFC9334].

   We use the terms certification signing request (CSR) and
   certification request interchangeably.

3.  Certificate Request Template Extension

   The following structure defines the attestation nonce provided by the
   CA/RA via a CertReqTemplate response message.  This leads to an extra
   roundtrip to convey the nonce to the end entity (and ultimately to
   the attester functionality inside the device).

      id-ce-attestionNonce OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::=  { id-ce TBD }

      AttestationNonce ::= OCTET STRING

   The end entity MUST construct a CertReqTemplate request message to
   trigger the RA/CA to transmit a nonce.

   When the RA/CA receive the CertReqTemplate request message the
   profile information is used to determine that the end entity supports
   attestation functionality.  If the end-entity supports attestation
   and the policy requires attestation information in a CSR to be
   provided, the RA/CA issues a CertReqTemplate response containing a
   nonce in in the template.  The AttestationNonce MUST contain a random
   value that depends on the used attestation technology.  For example,
   the PSA attestation token [I-D.tschofenig-rats-psa-token] supports
   nonces of length 32, 48 and 64 bytes.  Other attestation technologies
   use nonces of similar length.  The assumption in this specification
   is that the RA/CA have out-of-band knowledge about the required nonce
   length required for the technology used by the end entity.

   When the end entity receives the CertReqTemplate response it MUST use
   this nonce as input to the API call made to the attester
   functionality on the device.  While the semantic of the API call and
   the software/hardware architecture is out-of-scope of this
   specification, it will return evidence from the attester in a format
   specific to the attestation technology utilized.  The encoding of the
   returned evidence varies but will be placed inside the CSR, as
   specified in [I-D.ounsworth-csr-attestation].  The software creating
   the CSR will not have to interpret the evidence format - it is
   treated as an opaque blob.  It is important to note that the nonce is
   carried either implictily or explicitly in the evidence and it MUST
   NOT be conveyed in elements of the CSR.

   The processing of the CSR containing attestation information is
   described in [I-D.ounsworth-csr-attestation].  Note that the CA MUST
   NOT issue a certificate that contains the extension provided in the
   CertReqTemplate containing the nonce.  The nonce MUST only be used
   for determining freshness of the evidence provided by the attester.
   The nonce is not included in an X.509 certificate.

   [Editor's Note: It may be useful to augment the CertReqTemplate
   request with information about the type of attestation technology/
   technologies available on the end entity.  This is a topic for
   further discussion.]

4.  IANA Considerations

   TBD.

5.  Security Considerations

   This specification adds a nonce to the Certificate Request Template
   for use with attestation information in a CSR.  This specification
   assumes that the nonce does not require confidentiality protection
   without impacting the security property of the attestation protocol.
   [RFC9334] defining the IETF remote attestation architecture discusses
   this and other aspects in more detail.

   For the use of attestation in the CSR the security considerations of
   [I-D.ounsworth-csr-attestation] are relevant to this document.
