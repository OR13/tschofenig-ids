  Nonce-based Freshness for Remote Attestation in Certificate Signing
Requests (CSRs) for the Certification Management Protocol (CMP) and for
                 Enrollment over Secure Transport (EST)
                draft-tschofenig-lamps-nonce-cmp-est-00

Abstract

   Certificate Management Protocol (CMP) and Enrollment over Secure
   Transport (EST) define protocol messages for X.509v3 certificate
   creation and management.  Both protocol provide interactions between
   client systems and PKI components, such as a Registration Authority
   (RA) and a Certification Authority (CA).

   CMP and EST allow an RA/CA to inform an end entity about the
   information it has to provide in a certification request.  When an
   end entity places attestation Evidence in a Certificate Signing
   Request (CSR) it may need to demonstrate freshness of the provided
   Evidence.  Attestation technology today often accomplishes this task
   via the help of nonces.

   This document specifies how nonces are provided by an RA/CA to the
   end entity for inclusion in Evidence.

1.  Introduction

   Several protocols have been standardized to automate the management
   of certificates, such as certificate issuance, CA certificate
   provisioning, certificate renewal and certificate revocation.

   The Certificate Management Protocol (CMP) [I-D.ietf-lamps-rfc4210bis]
   defines protocol messages for X.509v3 certificate creation and
   management.  CMP provides interactions between end entities and PKI
   components, such as a Registration Authority (RA) and a Certification
   Authority (CA).

   Enrollment over Secure Transport (EST) [RFC7030] is another
   certificate management protocol, which provides a sub-set of the
   features offered by CMP.

Internet-Draft         Nonce Extension for CMP/EST          October 2023


   An end entity requesting a certificate from a Certification Authority
   (CA) may wish to offer believable claims about the protections
   afforded to the corresponding private key, such as whether the
   private key resides on a hardware security module or the protection
   capabilities provided by the hardware.

   To convey these claims in Evidence, as part of remote attestation,
   the remote attestation extension [I-D.ietf-lamps-csr-attestation] has
   been defined.  It describes how to encode Evidence produced by an
   Attester for inclusion in Certificate Signing Requests (CSRs), and
   any certificates necessary for validating it.

   A Verifier or Relying Party might need to learn the point in time an
   Evidence has been produced.  This is essential in deciding whether
   the included Claims can be considered fresh, meaning they still
   reflect the latest state of the Attester.

   Attestation technology available today, such as [TPM20] and
   [I-D.tschofenig-rats-psa-token], often accomplish freshness with the
   help of nonces.  More details about ensuring freshness of Evidence
   can be found in Section 10 of [RFC9334].

   Since an end entity needs to obtain a nonce from the Verifier via the
   Relying Party, this leads to an additional roundtrip.  The CSR is,
   however, a one-shot message.  For this reason CMP and EST are used by
   the end entity to obtain the nonce from the RA/CA.

   CMP and EST conveniently offer a mechanism to request information
   from the RA/CA prior to a certification request.

   Once the nonce is obtained the end entity can issue an API call to
   the Attester to request Evidence and passes the nonce as an input
   parameter into the API call.  The returned Evidence is then embedded
   into a CSR and returned to the RA/CA in a certification request
   message.

   Figure 1 shows this interaction graphically.  The nonce is obtained
   in step (1) using the extension to CMP/EST defined in this document.
   The CSR extension of [I-D.ietf-lamps-csr-attestation] is used to
   convey Evidence to the RA/CA in step (2).  The Verifier processes the
   received information and returns an Attestation Result to the Relying
   Party in step (3).

   The functionality of this document is described in three sections,
   namely:

   *  Section 3 describes how to convey the nonce CMP,

   *  Section 4 offers the equivalent functionality for EST, and

   *  Section 8 contains the ASN.1 description.

2.  Terminology and Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   The terms Attester, Relying Party, Verifier and Evidence are defined
   in [RFC9334].  The terms end entity, certification authority (CA),
   and registration authority (RA) are defined in [RFC5280].

   We use the terms Certificate Signing Request (CSR) and certification
   request interchangeably.

3.  Conveying a Nonce in CMP

   Section 5.3.19.16 of [I-D.ietf-lamps-rfc4210bis] defines the
   Certificate Request Template (CertReqTemplate) message for use with
   CMP.  The CertReqTemplateContent payload, which is sent by the CA/RA
   in response to a request message by the end entity, contains the
   nonce.

   The use of the Certificate Request Template request/response message
   exchange leads to an extra roundtrip to convey the nonce from the CA/
   RA to the end entity (and ultimately to the Attester inside the end
   entity).

   The end entity MUST construct a CertReqTemplate request message to
   trigger the RA/CA to transmit a nonce in the response.

   When the RA/CA receive the CertReqTemplate request message profile
   information is used to determine that the end entity supports this
   specification as well as [I-D.ietf-lamps-csr-attestation].  [Open
   Issue: Should request message indicate the remote attestation
   capability of the end entity rather than relying on "policy
   information"?  This may also allow to inform the CA/RA about the type
   of attestation technology/technologies available to the end entity.]

   If the end entity supports remote attestation and the policy requires
   Evidence in a CSR to be provided, the RA/CA issues a CertReqTemplate
   response containing a nonce in the template.

   Figure 2 showns the interaction graphically.

   Handle response
   Store certificate

   *: These steps require interactions with a Verifier.

              Figure 2: CMP Exchange with Nonce and Evidence.

4.  Conveying a Nonce in EST

   There are two ways an EST server can tell an EST client what values
   to use in a CSR, namely using:

   *  CSR Attributes Responses, as described in Section 4.5.2 of
      [RFC7030], and

   *  Additional CSR attributes, as described in Appendix B of
      [RFC8295].

   The latter functionality corresponds to the use of CSR templates in
   Section 3.  While this approach is preferred, an EST deployment may
   only support RFC 7030 and for this reason a CSR attribute to convey a
   nonce is defined.  Section 3.2 of [I-D.ietf-lamps-rfc7030-csrattrs]
   offers additional clarifications for use of CSR attributes.

5.  Nonce Processing Guidelines

   When the RA/CA is requested or configured to transmit a nonce to an
   end entity then it interacts with the Verifier.  The Verifier is,
   according to the IETF RATS architecture [RFC9334], "a role performed
   by an entity that appraises the validity of Evidence about an
   Attester and produces Attestation Results to be used by a Relying
   Party."  Since the Attester validates Evidence it is also the source
   of the nonce, at least indirectly, to check for replay.

   Once the nonce is available to the RA/CA, the nonce MUST be copied to
   the respective structure, as described in Section 4 and Section 3.
   The nonce value MUST contain a random byte sequence whereby the
   length depends on the used remote attestation technology.

   For example, the PSA attestation token
   [I-D.tschofenig-rats-psa-token] supports nonces of length 32, 48 and
   64 bytes.  Other attestation technologies use nonces of similar
   length.  The assumption in this specification is that the RA/CA have
   out-of-band knowledge about the required nonce length required for
   the attestation technology used by the end entity.

   When the end entity receives the nonce it MUST use it, if remote
   attestation is available and supports nonces.  It is better for an
   RA/CA to be aggressive in sending a nonce, at least where there is a
   reasonable chance the client supports remote attestation and the
   client should be allowed to ignore the nonce if it either does not
   support it or cannot use it for policy reasons.

   While the semantics of the attestation API and the software/hardware
   architecture is out-of-scope of this specification, the API will
   return Evidence from the Attester in a format specific to the
   attestation technology utilized.  The encoding of the returned
   evidence varies but will be placed inside the CSR, as specified in
   [I-D.ietf-lamps-csr-attestation].  The software creating the CSR will
   not have to interpret the Evidence format - it is treated as an
   opaque blob.  It is important to note that the nonce is carried in
   the Evidence, either implicitly or explicitly, and it MUST NOT be
   conveyed in CSR structures.

   The processing of the CSR containing Evidence is described in
   [I-D.ietf-lamps-csr-attestation].  Note that the issued certificates
   does not contain the nonce, as explained in
   [I-D.ietf-lamps-csr-attestation].

6.  IANA Considerations

   [Editor's Note: The ASN.1 module OID (TBD2) and the new private
   extension (TBD1) must be registered.]

7.  Security Considerations

   This specification adds a nonce to a Certificate Request Message
   Format (CRMF) extension and to PKCS#10 attribute.  This specification
   assumes that the nonce does not require confidentiality protection
   without impacting the security property of the remote attestation
   protocol.  [RFC9334] defines the IETF remote attestation architecture
   discusses nonce-based freshness in more detail.

   For the use of Evidence in the CSR the security considerations of
   [I-D.ietf-lamps-csr-attestation] are relevant to this document.
