  Nonce-based Freshness for Remote Attestation in Certificate Signing
Requests (CSRs) for the Certification Management Protocol (CMP) and for
                 Enrollment over Secure Transport (EST)
                draft-tschofenig-lamps-nonce-cmp-est-00

Abstract

   Certificate Management Protocol (CMP) and Enrollment over Secure
   Transport (EST) define protocol messages for X.509v3 certificate
   creation and management.  Both protocol provide interactions between
   client systems and PKI components, such as a Registration Authority
   (RA) and a Certification Authority (CA).

   CMP and EST allow an RA/CA to inform an end entity about the
   information it has to provide in a certification request.  When an
   end entity places attestation Evidence in a Certificate Signing
   Request (CSR) it may need to demonstrate freshness of the provided
   Evidence.  Attestation technology today often accomplishes this task
   via the help of nonces.

   This document specifies how nonces are provided by an RA/CA to the
   end entity for inclusion in evidence.

1.

   Certificate Management Protocol (CMP) [I-D.ietf-lamps-rfc4210bis]
   defines protocol messages for X.509v3 certificate creation and
   management.  CMP provides interactions between client systems and PKI
   components, such as a Registration Authority (RA) and a Certification
   Authority (CA).  Enrollment over Secure Transport (EST) [RFC7030] is
   another popular protocol for the management of certificates, which
   provides a sub-set of the features offered by CMP.

   Both protocols allow an RA/CA to inform an end entity about the
   information it has to provide in a certification request.  When an
   end entity places attestation Evidence in a Certificate Signing
   Request (CSR) it may need to demonstrate freshness of the provided
   Evidence.  This extension to a CSR is described in
   [I-D.ietf-lamps-csr-attestation].  Attestation technology today, such
   as [TPM20] and [I-D.tschofenig-rats-psa-token], often accomplishes
   this task via the help of nonces.  A discussion of freshness
   approaches for Evidence is found in Section 10 of [RFC9334].

   To include a nonce in Evidence by the Attester at the an end entity
   it is necessary to obtain this nonce from the Relying Party, i.e. RA/
   CA in our use case, first.  Since the CSR itself is a 'one-shot'
   message the CMP/EST protocols are used to obtain the nonce from the
   RA/CA.

   CMP already offers a mechanism to request information from the RA/CA
   prior to a certification request.  The same is true for EST.

   Once the nonce is obtained the end entity can issue an API call to
   the Attester to request Evidence and passes the nonce as an input
   parameter into the API call.  The returned Evidence is then embedded

   into a CSR and returned to the RA/CA in a certification request
   message.

   The main functionality of this document is described in three
   sections, namely:

   -  [CMP] describes how to convey the nonce CMP,

   -  Section 4 offers the equivalent functionality for EST, and

   -  Section 8 contains the ASN.1 description.

2.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   The terms Attester, Relying Party, Verifier and Evidence are defined
   in [RFC9334].

   We use the terms certification signing request (CSR) and
   certification request interchangeably.

3.

   Section 5.3.19.16 of [I-D.ietf-lamps-rfc4210bis] defines the
   Certificate Request Template (CertReqTemplate) message for use with
   CMP.  The CertReqTemplateContent payload, which is sent by the CA/RA
   in response to a request message by the end entity, contains the
   nonce.  The use of the Certificate Request Template request/response
   message exchange leads to an extra roundtrip to convey the nonce from
   the CA/RA to the end entity (and ultimately to the Attester inside
   the device).

   The end entity MUST construct a CertReqTemplate request message to
   trigger the RA/CA to transmit a nonce in the response.

   When the RA/CA receive the CertReqTemplate request message the
   profile information is used to determine that the end entity supports
   this specification as well as [I-D.ietf-lamps-csr-attestation].  If
   the end entity supports remote attestation and the policy requires
   Evidence in a CSR to be provided, the RA/CA issues a CertReqTemplate
   response containing a nonce in in the template.

   The following exchange showns the interaction graphically.

   *: These steps require interactions with a Verifier.

   EST offers two ways an EST server can use to tell the EST client what
   values to use in a CSR.  These two approaches are described

   -  in Section 4.5.2 of [RFC7030], and

   -  in Appendix B of [RFC8295].

   The latter functionality corresponds to the use of CSR templates in
   [CMP].  While this approach is preferred, an EST deployment may only
   support RFC 7030 functionality and for this reason a CSR attribute to
   convey a nonce is defined.  [I-D.ietf-lamps-rfc7030-csrattrs] offers
   additional clarifications for use of CSR attributes in Section 3.2.

5.

   When the RA/CA is requested or configured to transmit a nonce to an
   end entity then it interacts with the Verifier.  The Verifier is,
   according to the IETF RATS architecture Authors' Addresses, "a role
   performed by an entity that appraises the validity of Evidence about

   an Attester and produces Attestation Results to be used by a Relying
   Party."  Since the Attester validates Evidence it is also the source
   of the nonce, at least indirectly, to check for replay.

   Once the nonce is available to the RA/CA, the nonce MUST be copied to
   the EvidenceNonce field.  It MUST contain a random byte sequence
   whereby the length depends on the used remote attestation technology.
   For example, the PSA attestation token
   [I-D.tschofenig-rats-psa-token] supports nonces of length 32, 48 and
   64 bytes.  Other attestation technologies use nonces of similar
   length.  The assumption in this specification is that the RA/CA have
   out-of-band knowledge about the required nonce length required for
   the attestation technology used by the end entity.

   When the end entity receives the nonce it SHOULD use it as input to
   an attestation API call made to the Attester on the device.  The
   rational behind this "SHOULD"-requirement, rather than a "MUST"-
   requirement, is that the end entity may support remote attestation
   but configuration or policies make it unavailable.  Hence, it is
   better for an RA/CA to be aggressive in sending a nonce, at least
   where there is a reasonable chance the client supports remote
   attestation and the client should be allowed to ignore the nonce if
   it either does not support it or cannot use it for policy reasons.

   While the semantic of the attestation API and the software/hardware
   architecture is out-of-scope of this specification, the API will
   return Evidence from the Attester in a format specific to the
   attestation technology utilized.  The encoding of the returned
   evidence varies but will be placed inside the CSR, as specified in
   [I-D.ietf-lamps-csr-attestation].  The software creating the CSR will
   not have to interpret the Evidence format - it is treated as an
   opaque blob.  It is important to note that the nonce is carried in
   the Evidence, either implictily or explicitly, and it MUST NOT be
   conveyed in elements of the CSR.

   The processing of the CSR containing Evidence is described in
   [I-D.ietf-lamps-csr-attestation].  Note that the issued certificates
   does not contain the nonce, as explained in
   [I-D.ietf-lamps-csr-attestation].  Instead, it is typically embedded
   in the Evidence and used as a way to provide freshness of the
   Evidence signed by the Attester.

7.

   This specification adds a nonce to a Certificate Request Message
   Format (CRMF) extension and to PKCS#10 attribute.  This specification
   assumes that the nonce does not require confidentiality protection
   without impacting the security property of the remote attestation
   protocol.  [RFC9334] defines the IETF remote attestation architecture
   discusses nonce-based freshness in more detail.

   For the use of Evidence in the CSR the security considerations of
   [I-D.ietf-lamps-csr-attestation] are relevant to this document.
