   The Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) Protocol Version 1.3
                      draft-ietf-tls-dtls13-latest

Abstract

   This document specifies Version 1.3 of the Datagram Transport Layer
   Security (DTLS) protocol.  DTLS 1.3 allows client/server applications
   to communicate over the Internet in a way that is designed to prevent
   eavesdropping, tampering, and message forgery.

   The DTLS 1.3 protocol is intentionally based on the Transport Layer
   Security (TLS) 1.3 protocol and provides equivalent security
   guarantees.  Datagram semantics of the underlying transport are
   preserved by the DTLS protocol.

1.  Introduction

   RFC EDITOR: PLEASE REMOVE THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH The source for this
   draft is maintained in GitHub.  Suggested changes should be submitted
   as pull requests at https://github.com/tlswg/dtls13-spec.
   Instructions are on that page as well.  Editorial changes can be
   managed in GitHub, but any substantive change should be discussed on
   the TLS mailing list.

   The primary goal of the TLS protocol is to provide privacy and data
   integrity between two communicating peers.  The TLS protocol is
   composed of two layers: the TLS Record Protocol and the TLS Handshake
   Protocol.  However, TLS must run over a reliable transport channel -
   typically TCP [RFC0793].

   There are applications that utilize UDP as a transport and to offer
   communication security protection for those applications the Datagram
   Transport Layer Security (DTLS) protocol has been designed.  DTLS is
   deliberately designed to be as similar to TLS as possible, both to
   minimize new security invention and to maximize the amount of code
   and infrastructure reuse.

   DTLS 1.0 was originally defined as a delta from TLS 1.1 and DTLS 1.2
   was defined as a series of deltas to TLS 1.2.  There is no DTLS 1.1;
   that version number was skipped in order to harmonize version numbers
   with TLS.  This specification describes the most current version of
   the DTLS protocol aligning with the efforts around TLS 1.3.

   Implementations that speak both DTLS 1.2 and DTLS 1.3 can
   interoperate with those that speak only DTLS 1.2 (using DTLS 1.2 of
   course), just as TLS 1.3 implementations can interoperate with TLS
   1.2 (see Appendix C of [TLS13] for details).  While backwards
   compatibility with DTLS 1.0 is possible the use of DTLS 1.0 is not
   recommended as explained in Section 3.1.2 of RFC 7525 [RFC7525].

2.  Conventions and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
   2119 [RFC2119].

   The following terms are used:

   -  client: The endpoint initiating the TLS connection.

   -  connection: A transport-layer connection between two endpoints.

   -  endpoint: Either the client or server of the connection.

   -  handshake: An initial negotiation between client and server that
      establishes the parameters of their transactions.

   -  peer: An endpoint.  When discussing a particular endpoint, "peer"
      refers to the endpoint that is remote to the primary subject of
      discussion.

   -  receiver: An endpoint that is receiving records.

   -  sender: An endpoint that is transmitting records.

   -  session: An association between a client and a server resulting
      from a handshake.

   -  server: The endpoint which did not initiate the TLS connection.

   The reader is assumed to be familiar with the TLS 1.3 specification
   since this document defined as a delta from TLS 1.3.

3.  DTLS Design Rational and Overview

   The basic design philosophy of DTLS is to construct "TLS over
   datagram transport".  Datagram transport does not require or provide
   reliable or in-order delivery of data.  The DTLS protocol preserves
   this property for application data.  Applications such as media
   streaming, Internet telephony, and online gaming use datagram
   transport for communication due to the delay-sensitive nature of
   transported data.  The behavior of such applications is unchanged
   when the DTLS protocol is used to secure communication, since the
   DTLS protocol does not compensate for lost or re-ordered data
   traffic.

Internet-Draft                     TLS                    September 2016


   The reason that TLS cannot be used directly in datagram environments
   is simply that payloads may be lost or reordered.  Unreliability and
   reordering creates problems for TLS at three levels:

   1.  TLS does not allow independent decryption of individual records.
       Because the integrity check depends on the sequence number, if
       record N is not received, then the integrity check on record N+1
       will be based on the wrong sequence number and thus will fail.
       DTLS solves this problem by adding explicit sequence numbers.

   2.  The TLS handshake is a lock-step cryptographic handshake.
       Messages must be transmitted and received in a defined order; any
       other order is an error.  Clearly, this is incompatible with
       reordering and message loss.  In addition, TLS handshake messages
       are potentially larger than any given datagram, thus creating the
       problem of IP fragmentation.  DTLS provides fixes for both of
       these problems, as described in the subsections below.

   3.  Not all TLS 1.3 handshake messages (such as the NewSessionTicket
       message) are acknowledged.  Hence, a new acknowledgement message
       has to be integrated to detect message loss.

   The DTLS 1.3 specification changes the way how cookies are exchanged
   compared to DTLS 1.2.  DTLS 1.3 re-uses the HelloRetryRequest message
   and conveys the cookie to the client via an extension.  The client
   then uses the same extension to place the cookie into a ClientHello
   message.  DTLS 1.2 on the other hand used a separate message, namely
   the HelloVerifyRequest, to pass a cookie to the client and did not
   utilize the extension mechanism.  For backwards compatibility reason
   the cookie field in the ClientHello is present in DTLS 1.3 but is
   ignored by a DTLS 1.3 compliant server implementation.

3.1.  Packet Loss

   DTLS uses a simple retransmission timer to handle packet loss.
   {{dtls-retransmission} demonstrates the basic concept, using the
   first phase of the DTLS handshake:

            Client                                   Server
            ------                                   ------
            ClientHello           ------>

                                    X<-- HelloRetryRequest
                                                     (lost)

            [Timer Expires]

            ClientHello           ------>
            (retransmit)

                  Figure 1: DTLS Retransmission Example.

   Once the client has transmitted the ClientHello message, it expects
   to see a HelloRetryRequest from the server.  However, if the server's
   message is lost, the client knows that either the ClientHello or the
   HelloRetryRequest has been lost and retransmits.  When the server
   receives the retransmission, it knows to retransmit.

   The server also maintains a retransmission timer and retransmits when
   that timer expires.

   Note that timeout and retransmission do not apply to the
   HelloRetryRequest since this would require creating state on the
   server.  The HelloRetryRequest is designed to be small enough that it
   will not itself be fragmented, thus avoiding concerns about
   interleaving multiple HelloRetryRequests.

3.1.1.  Reordering

   In DTLS, each handshake message is assigned a specific sequence
   number within that handshake.  When a peer receives a handshake
   message, it can quickly determine whether that message is the next
   message it expects.  If it is, then it processes it.  If not, it
   queues it for future handling once all previous messages have been
   received.

3.1.2.  Message Size

   TLS and DTLS handshake messages can be quite large (in theory up to
   2^24-1 bytes, in practice many kilobytes).  By contrast, UDP
   datagrams are often limited to <1500 bytes if IP fragmentation is not
   desired.  In order to compensate for this limitation, each DTLS
   handshake message may be fragmented over several DTLS records, each
   of which is intended to fit in a single IP datagram.  Each DTLS
   handshake message contains both a fragment offset and a fragment

   length.  Thus, a recipient in possession of all bytes of a handshake
   message can reassemble the original unfragmented message.

3.2.  Replay Detection

   DTLS optionally supports record replay detection.  The technique used
   is the same as in IPsec AH/ESP, by maintaining a bitmap window of
   received records.  Records that are too old to fit in the window and
   records that have previously been received are silently discarded.
   The replay detection feature is optional, since packet duplication is
   not always malicious, but can also occur due to routing errors.
   Applications may conceivably detect duplicate packets and accordingly
   modify their data transmission strategy.

4.  The DTLS Record Layer

   The DTLS record layer is extremely similar to that of TLS 1.3.  The
   only change is the inclusion of an explicit epoch and sequence number
   in the record.  This sequence number allows the recipient to
   correctly verify the TLS MAC.  The DTLS record format is shown below:

     struct {
          ContentType type;
          ProtocolVersion version = { 254, 253 };
          uint16 epoch;                         // DTLS-related field
          uint48 sequence_number;               // DTLS-related field
          uint16 length;
          opaque fragment[DTLSPlaintext.length];
        } DTLSPlaintext;

   type:  Identical to the type field in a TLS 1.3 record.

   version:  This specification re-uses the DTLS version 1.2 version
      number, namely { 254, 253 }. This field is deprecated and MUST be
      ignored for all purposes.

   epoch:  A counter value that is incremented on every cipher state
      change.

   sequence_number:  The sequence number for this record.

   length:  Identical to the length field in a TLS 1.3 record.

   fragment:  Identical to the fragment field in a TLS 1.3 record.

   DTLS uses an explicit sequence number, rather than an implicit one,
   carried in the sequence_number field of the record.  Sequence numbers
   are maintained separately for each epoch, with each sequence_number

   initially being 0 for each epoch.  For instance, if a handshake
   message from epoch 0 is retransmitted, it might have a sequence
   number after a message from epoch 1, even if the message from epoch 1
   was transmitted first.  Note that some care needs to be taken during
   the handshake to ensure that retransmitted messages use the right
   epoch and keying material.

   If several handshakes are performed in close succession, there might
   be multiple records on the wire with the same sequence number but
   from different cipher states.  The epoch field allows recipients to
   distinguish such packets.  The epoch number is initially zero and is
   incremented each time keying material changes and a sender aims to
   rekey.  More details are provided in Section 5.9.  In order to ensure
   that any given sequence/epoch pair is unique, implementations MUST
   NOT allow the same epoch value to be reused within two times the TCP
   maximum segment lifetime.

   Note that because DTLS records may be reordered, a record from epoch
   1 may be received after epoch 2 has begun.  In general,
   implementations SHOULD discard packets from earlier epochs, but if
   packet loss causes noticeable problems they MAY choose to retain
   keying material from previous epochs for up to the default MSL
   specified for TCP [TCP] to allow for packet reordering.  (Note that
   the intention here is that implementers use the current guidance from
   the IETF for MSL, not that they attempt to interrogate the MSL that
   the system TCP stack is using.)  Until the handshake has completed,
   implementations MUST accept packets from the old epoch.

   Conversely, it is possible for records that are protected by the
   newly negotiated context to be received prior to the completion of a
   handshake.  For instance, the server may send its Finished message
   and then start transmitting data.  Implementations MAY either buffer
   or discard such packets, though when DTLS is used over reliable
   transports (e.g., SCTP), they SHOULD be buffered and processed once
   the handshake completes.  Note that TLS's restrictions on when
   packets may be sent still apply, and the receiver treats the packets
   as if they were sent in the right order.  In particular, it is still
   impermissible to send data prior to completion of the first
   handshake.

   As in TLS, implementations MUST either abandon an association or re-
   key using a KeyUpdate message prior to allowing the sequence number
   to wrap.

   Implementations MUST NOT allow the epoch to wrap, but instead MUST
   establish a new association, terminating the old association.

4.1.  Transport Layer Mapping

   Each DTLS record MUST fit within a single datagram.  In order to
   avoid IP fragmentation, clients of the DTLS record layer SHOULD
   attempt to size records so that they fit within any PMTU estimates
   obtained from the record layer.

   Note that unlike IPsec, DTLS records do not contain any association
   identifiers.  Applications must arrange to multiplex between
   associations.  With UDP, this is presumably done with the host/port
   number.

   Multiple DTLS records may be placed in a single datagram.  They are
   simply encoded consecutively.  The DTLS record framing is sufficient
   to determine the boundaries.  Note, however, that the first byte of
   the datagram payload must be the beginning of a record.  Records may
   not span datagrams.

   Some transports, such as DCCP [RFC4340] provide their own sequence
   numbers.  When carried over those transports, both the DTLS and the
   transport sequence numbers will be present.  Although this introduces
   a small amount of inefficiency, the transport layer and DTLS sequence
   numbers serve different purposes; therefore, for conceptual
   simplicity, it is superior to use both sequence numbers.

   Some transports provide congestion control for traffic carried over
   them.  If the congestion window is sufficiently narrow, DTLS
   handshake retransmissions may be held rather than transmitted
   immediately, potentially leading to timeouts and spurious
   retransmission.  When DTLS is used over such transports, care should
   be taken not to overrun the likely congestion window.  [RFC5238]
   defines a mapping of DTLS to DCCP that takes these issues into
   account.

4.2.  PMTU Issues

   In general, DTLS's philosophy is to leave PMTU discovery to the
   application.  However, DTLS cannot completely ignore PMTU for three
   reasons:

   -  The DTLS record framing expands the datagram size, thus lowering
      the effective PMTU from the application's perspective.

   -  In some implementations, the application may not directly talk to
      the network, in which case the DTLS stack may absorb ICMP
      [RFC1191] "Datagram Too Big" indications or ICMPv6 [RFC4443]
      "Packet Too Big" indications.

   -  The DTLS handshake messages can exceed the PMTU.

      In order to deal with the first two issues, the DTLS record layer
      SHOULD behave as described below.

      If PMTU estimates are available from the underlying transport
      protocol, they should be made available to upper layer protocols.
      In particular:

   -  For DTLS over UDP, the upper layer protocol SHOULD be allowed to
      obtain the PMTU estimate maintained in the IP layer.

   -  For DTLS over DCCP, the upper layer protocol SHOULD be allowed to
      obtain the current estimate of the PMTU.

   -  For DTLS over TCP or SCTP, which automatically fragment and
      reassemble datagrams, there is no PMTU limitation.  However, the
      upper layer protocol MUST NOT write any record that exceeds the
      maximum record size of 2^14 bytes.

      The DTLS record layer SHOULD allow the upper layer protocol to
      discover the amount of record expansion expected by the DTLS
      processing.

      If there is a transport protocol indication (either via ICMP or
      via a refusal to send the datagram as in Section 14 of [RFC4340]),
      then the DTLS record layer MUST inform the upper layer protocol of
      the error.

      The DTLS record layer SHOULD NOT interfere with upper layer
      protocols performing PMTU discovery, whether via [RFC1191] or
      [RFC4821] mechanisms.  In particular:

   -  Where allowed by the underlying transport protocol, the upper
      layer protocol SHOULD be allowed to set the state of the DF bit
      (in IPv4) or prohibit local fragmentation (in IPv6).

   -  If the underlying transport protocol allows the application to
      request PMTU probing (e.g., DCCP), the DTLS record layer should
      honor this request.

      The final issue is the DTLS handshake protocol.  From the
      perspective of the DTLS record layer, this is merely another upper
      layer protocol.  However, DTLS handshakes occur infrequently and
      involve only a few round trips; therefore, the handshake protocol
      PMTU handling places a premium on rapid completion over accurate
      PMTU discovery.  In order to allow connections under these

      circumstances, DTLS implementations SHOULD follow the following
      rules:

   -  If the DTLS record layer informs the DTLS handshake layer that a
      message is too big, it SHOULD immediately attempt to fragment it,
      using any existing information about the PMTU.

   -  If repeated retransmissions do not result in a response, and the
      PMTU is unknown, subsequent retransmissions SHOULD back off to a
      smaller record size, fragmenting the handshake message as
      appropriate.  This standard does not specify an exact number of
      retransmits to attempt before backing off, but 2-3 seems
      appropriate.

4.3.  Record Payload Protection

   Like TLS, DTLS transmits data as a series of protected records.  The
   rest of this section describes the details of that format.

4.3.1.  Anti-Replay

   DTLS records contain a sequence number to provide replay protection.
   Sequence number verification SHOULD be performed using the following
   sliding window procedure, borrowed from Section 3.4.3 of [RFC4303].

   The receiver packet counter for this session MUST be initialized to
   zero when the session is established.  For each received record, the
   receiver MUST verify that the record contains a sequence number that
   does not duplicate the sequence number of any other record received
   during the life of this session.  This SHOULD be the first check
   applied to a packet after it has been matched to a session, to speed
   rejection of duplicate records.

   Duplicates are rejected through the use of a sliding receive window.
   (How the window is implemented is a local matter, but the following
   text describes the functionality that the implementation must
   exhibit.)  A minimum window size of 32 MUST be supported, but a
   window size of 64 is preferred and SHOULD be employed as the default.
   Another window size (larger than the minimum) MAY be chosen by the
   receiver.  (The receiver does not notify the sender of the window
   size.)

   The "right" edge of the window represents the highest validated
   sequence number value received on this session.  Records that contain
   sequence numbers lower than the "left" edge of the window are
   rejected.  Packets falling within the window are checked against a
   list of received packets within the window.  An efficient means for

   performing this check, based on the use of a bit mask, is described
   in Section 3.4.3 of [RFC4303].

   If the received record falls within the window and is new, or if the
   packet is to the right of the window, then the receiver proceeds to
   MAC verification.  If the MAC validation fails, the receiver MUST
   discard the received record as invalid.  The receive window is
   updated only if the MAC verification succeeds.

4.3.2.  Handling Invalid Records

   Unlike TLS, DTLS is resilient in the face of invalid records (e.g.,
   invalid formatting, length, MAC, etc.).  In general, invalid records
   SHOULD be silently discarded, thus preserving the association;
   however, an error MAY be logged for diagnostic purposes.
   Implementations which choose to generate an alert instead, MUST
   generate fatal level alerts to avoid attacks where the attacker
   repeatedly probes the implementation to see how it responds to
   various types of error.  Note that if DTLS is run over UDP, then any
   implementation which does this will be extremely susceptible to
   denial-of-service (DoS) attacks because UDP forgery is so easy.
   Thus, this practice is NOT RECOMMENDED for such transports.

   If DTLS is being carried over a transport that is resistant to
   forgery (e.g., SCTP with SCTP-AUTH), then it is safer to send alerts
   because an attacker will have difficulty forging a datagram that will
   not be rejected by the transport layer.

5.  The DTLS Handshake Protocol

   DTLS 1.3 re-uses the TLS 1.3 handshake messages and flows, with the
   following changes:

   1.  To handle message loss, reordering, and fragmentation
       modifications to the handshake header are necessary.

   2.  Retransmission timers are introduced to handle message loss.

   3.  The TLS 1.3 KeyUpdate message is not used in DTLS 1.3 for re-
       keying.

   4.  A new ACK message is introduced to more robustness in message
       delivery.

   Note that TLS 1.3 already supports a cookie extension, which used to
   prevent denial-of-service attacks.  This DoS prevention mechanism is
   described in more detail below since UDP-based protocols are more
   vulnerable to amplification attacks than a connection-oriented

   transport like TCP that performs return-routability checks as part of
   the connection establishment.

   With these exceptions, the DTLS message formats, flows, and logic are
   the same as those of TLS 1.3.

5.1.  Denial-of-Service Countermeasures

   Datagram security protocols are extremely susceptible to a variety of
   DoS attacks.  Two attacks are of particular concern:

   1.  An attacker can consume excessive resources on the server by
       transmitting a series of handshake initiation requests, causing
       the server to allocate state and potentially to perform expensive
       cryptographic operations.

   2.  An attacker can use the server as an amplifier by sending
       connection initiation messages with a forged source of the
       victim.  The server then sends its next message (in DTLS, a
       Certificate message, which can be quite large) to the victim
       machine, thus flooding it.

   In order to counter both of these attacks, DTLS borrows the stateless
   cookie technique used by Photuris [RFC2522] and IKE [RFC5996].  When
   the client sends its ClientHello message to the server, the server
   MAY respond with a HelloRetryRequest message.  The HelloRetryRequest
   message as well as the cookie extension is defined in TLS 1.3.  The
   HelloRetryRequest message contains a stateless cookie generated using
   the technique of [RFC2522].  The client MUST retransmit the
   ClientHello with the cookie added as an extension.  The server then
   verifies the cookie and proceeds with the handshake only if it is
   valid.  This mechanism forces the attacker/client to be able to
   receive the cookie, which makes DoS attacks with spoofed IP addresses
   difficult.  This mechanism does not provide any defence against DoS
   attacks mounted from valid IP addresses.

   The exchange is shown in Figure 2.  Note that the figure focuses on
   the cookie exchange; all other extensions are omitted.

     Figure 2: DTLS Exchange with HelloRetryRequest contain the Cookie
                                 Extension

   The cookie extension is defined in Section 4.2.1 of [TLS13].  When
   sending the initial ClientHello, the client does not have a cookie
   yet.  In this case, the cookie extension is omitted and the
   legacy_cookie field in the ClientHello message SHOULD be set to a
   zero length vector (i.e., a single zero byte length field) and MUST
   be ignored by a server negotiating DTLS 1.3.

   When responding to a HelloRetryRequest, the client MUST use the same
   parameter values (version, random, cipher_suites) as it did in the
   original ClientHello.

   The server SHOULD use those values to generate its cookie and verify
   that they are correct upon cookie receipt.  The server MUST use the
   same version number in the HelloRetryRequest that it would use when
   sending a ServerHello.  Upon receipt of the ServerHello, the client
   MUST verify that the server version values match.

   In order to avoid sequence number duplication in case of multiple
   HelloRetryRequests, the server MUST use the record sequence number in
   the ClientHello as the record sequence number in the
   HelloRetryRequest.

   When the second ClientHello is received, the server can verify that
   the cookie is valid and that the client can receive packets at the
   given IP address.  In order to avoid sequence number duplication in
   case of multiple cookie exchanges, the server MUST use the record
   sequence number in the ClientHello as the record sequence number in
   its initial ServerHello.  Subsequent ServerHellos will only be sent
   after the server has created state and MUST increment normally.

   One potential attack on this scheme is for the attacker to collect a
   number of cookies from different addresses and then reuse them to
   attack the server.  The server can defend against this attack by

Internet-Draft                     TLS                    September 2016


   changing the secret value frequently, thus invalidating those
   cookies.  If the server wishes that legitimate clients be able to
   handshake through the transition (e.g., they received a cookie with
   Secret 1 and then sent the second ClientHello after the server has
   changed to Secret 2), the server can have a limited window during
   which it accepts both secrets.  [RFC5996] suggests adding a key
   identifier to cookies to detect this case.  An alternative approach
   is simply to try verifying with both secrets.

   Servers MUST implement a key rotation scheme that allows the server
   to manage keys with overlapping lifetime.

   DTLS servers SHOULD perform a cookie exchange whenever a new
   handshake is being performed.  If the server is being operated in an
   environment where amplification is not a problem, the server MAY be
   configured not to perform a cookie exchange.  The default SHOULD be
   that the exchange is performed, however.  In addition, the server MAY
   choose not to do a cookie exchange when a session is resumed.
   Clients MUST be prepared to do a cookie exchange with every
   handshake.

   If the HelloRetryRequest message is used, the initial ClientHello and
   the HelloRetryRequest are included in the calculation of the
   handshake_messages (for the CertificateVerify message) and
   verify_data (for the Finished message).

   If a server receives a ClientHello with an invalid cookie, it MUST
   respond with a HelloRetryRequest.  To avoid repeatly entering a
   ClientHello (+ cookie) / HelloRetryRequests exchange interaction a
   client MUST reject a second HelloRetryRequest.  Restarting the
   handshake from scratch allows the client to recover from a situation
   where it obtained a cookie that cannot be verified by the server.

5.2.  DTLS Handshake Message Format

   In order to support message loss, reordering, and message
   fragmentation, DTLS modifies the TLS 1.3 handshake header:

   In addition to the handshake messages that are deprecated by the TLS

   1.3-compliant implements MUST NOT use the HelloVerifyRequest to
   execute a return-routability check.  A dual-stack DTLS 1.2/DTLS 1.3
   client must, however, be prepared to interact with a DTLS 1.2 server.

   A DTLS 1.3 MUST NOT use the KeyUpdate message to change keying
   material used for the protection of traffic data.  Instead the epoch
   field is used, which is explained in Section 5.9.

   The format of the ClientHello used by a DTLS 1.3 client differs from
   the TLS 1.3 ClientHello format as shown below.

   struct {
        ProtocolVersion client_version = { 254,252 };    /* DTLS v1.3 */
        Random random;
        opaque legacy_session_id<0..32>;
        opaque legacy_cookie<0..2^8-1>;                  // DTLS
        CipherSuite cipher_suites<2..2^16-2>;
        opaque legacy_compression_methods<1..2^8-1>;
        Extension extensions<0..2^16-1>;
    } ClientHello;

   client_version:  The version of the DTLS protocol by which the client
      wishes to communicate during this session.  This SHOULD be the
      latest (highest valued) version supported by the client.  For the
      DTLS 1.3 version of the specification, the version will be {
      254,252 }.

   random:  Same as for TLS 1.3

   legacy_session_id:  Same as for TLS 1.3

   legacy_cookie:  A DTLS 1.3-only client MUST set the legacy_cookie
      field to zero length.

   cipher_suites:  Same as for TLS 1.3

   legacy_compression_methods:  Same as for TLS 1.3

   extensions:  Same as for TLS 1.3

   The first message each side transmits in each handshake always has
   message_seq = 0.  Whenever each new message is generated, the
   message_seq value is incremented by one.  Note that in the case of a
   rehandshake, this implies that the HelloRetryRequest will have
   message_seq = 0 and the ServerHello will have message_seq = 1.  When
   a message is retransmitted, the same message_seq value is used.

   Here is an example:

   Note, however, that from the perspective of the DTLS record layer,
   the retransmission is a new record.  This record will have a new
   DTLSPlaintext.sequence_number value.

   DTLS implementations maintain (at least notionally) a
   next_receive_seq counter.  This counter is initially set to zero.
   When a message is received, if its sequence number matches
   next_receive_seq, next_receive_seq is incremented and the message is
   processed.  If the sequence number is less than next_receive_seq, the
   message MUST be discarded.  If the sequence number is greater than
   next_receive_seq, the implementation SHOULD queue the message but MAY
   discard it.  (This is a simple space/bandwidth tradeoff).

5.3.  ACK Message

   struct {} ACK;

   The ACK handshake message is used by a server to return a response to
   a client-provided message where the TLS 1.3 handshake does not
   foresee a return message.  With the use of the ACK message the client
   is able to determine whether a transmitted request has been lost and
   needs to be retransmitted.

5.4.  Handshake Message Fragmentation and Reassembly

   Each DTLS message MUST fit within a single transport layer datagram.
   However, handshake messages are potentially bigger than the maximum
   record size.  Therefore, DTLS provides a mechanism for fragmenting a
   handshake message over a number of records, each of which can be
   transmitted separately, thus avoiding IP fragmentation.

   When transmitting the handshake message, the sender divides the
   message into a series of N contiguous data ranges.  These ranges MUST
   NOT be larger than the maximum handshake fragment size and MUST
   jointly contain the entire handshake message.  The ranges MUST NOT
   overlap.  The sender then creates N handshake messages, all with the
   same message_seq value as the original handshake message.  Each new
   message is labeled with the fragment_offset (the number of bytes
   contained in previous fragments) and the fragment_length (the length
   of this fragment).  The length field in all messages is the same as
   the length field of the original message.  An unfragmented message is
   a degenerate case with fragment_offset=0 and fragment_length=length.

   When a DTLS implementation receives a handshake message fragment, it
   MUST buffer it until it has the entire handshake message.  DTLS
   implementations MUST be able to handle overlapping fragment ranges.
   This allows senders to retransmit handshake messages with smaller
   fragment sizes if the PMTU estimate changes.

   Note that as with TLS, multiple handshake messages may be placed in
   the same DTLS record, provided that there is room and that they are
   part of the same flight.  Thus, there are two acceptable ways to pack
   two DTLS messages into the same datagram: in the same record or in
   separate records.

5.5.  Timeout and Retransmission

   DTLS messages are grouped into a series of message flights, according
   to the diagrams below.  Although each flight of messages may consist
   of a number of messages, they should be viewed as monolithic for the
   purpose of timeout and retransmission.

5.5.1.  State Machine

   DTLS uses a simple timeout and retransmission scheme with the state
   machine shown in {{dtls-timeout-state-machine}.  Because DTLS clients
   send the first message (ClientHello), they start in the PREPARING
   state.  DTLS servers start in the WAITING state, but with empty
   buffers and no retransmit timer.

   The state machine has three basic states.

   In the PREPARING state, the implementation does whatever computations
   are necessary to prepare the next flight of messages.  It then
   buffers them up for transmission (emptying the buffer first) and
   enters the SENDING state.

   In the SENDING state, the implementation transmits the buffered
   flight of messages.  Once the messages have been sent, the
   implementation then enters the FINISHED state if this is the last
   flight in the handshake.  Or, if the implementation expects to
   receive more messages, it sets a retransmit timer and then enters the
   WAITING state.

   There are three ways to exit the WAITING state:

   1.  The retransmit timer expires: the implementation transitions to
       the SENDING state, where it retransmits the flight, resets the
       retransmit timer, and returns to the WAITING state.

   2.  The implementation reads a retransmitted flight from the peer:
       the implementation transitions to the SENDING state, where it
       retransmits the flight, resets the retransmit timer, and returns
       to the WAITING state.  The rationale here is that the receipt of
       a duplicate message is the likely result of timer expiry on the
       peer and therefore suggests that part of one's previous flight
       was lost.

   3.  The implementation receives the next flight of messages: if this
       is the final flight of messages, the implementation transitions
       to FINISHED.  If the implementation needs to send a new flight,
       it transitions to the PREPARING state.  Partial reads (whether
       partial messages or only some of the messages in the flight) do
       not cause state transitions or timer resets.

       Because DTLS clients send the first message (ClientHello), they
       start in the PREPARING state.  DTLS servers start in the WAITING
       state, but with empty buffers and no retransmit timer.

       When the server desires a rehandshake, it transitions from the
       FINISHED state to the PREPARING state to transmit the
       HelloRequest.  When the client receives a HelloRequest, it
       transitions from FINISHED to PREPARING to transmit the
       ClientHello.

       In addition, for at least twice the default Maximum Segment
       Lifetime (MSL) defined for [TCP], when in the FINISHED state, the
       node that transmits the last flight (the server in an ordinary

       handshake or the client in a resumed handshake) MUST respond to a
       retransmit of the peer's last flight with a retransmit of the
       last flight.  This avoids deadlock conditions if the last flight
       gets lost.  To see why this is necessary, consider what happens
       in an ordinary handshake if the server's Finished message is
       lost: the server believes the handshake is complete but it
       actually is not.  As the client is waiting for the Finished
       message, the client's retransmit timer will fire and it will
       retransmit the client's Finished message.  This will cause the
       server to respond with its own Finished message, completing the
       handshake.  The same logic applies on the server side for the
       resumed handshake.

       Note that because of packet loss, it is possible for one side to
       be sending application data even though the other side has not
       received the first side's Finished message.  Implementations MUST
       either discard or buffer all application data packets for the new
       epoch until they have received the Finished message for that
       epoch.  Implementations MAY treat receipt of application data
       with a new epoch prior to receipt of the corresponding Finished
       message as evidence of reordering or packet loss and retransmit
       their final flight immediately, shortcutting the retransmission
       timer.

5.5.2.  Timer Values

   Though timer values are the choice of the implementation, mishandling
   of the timer can lead to serious congestion problems; for example, if
   many instances of a DTLS time out early and retransmit too quickly on
   a congested link.  Implementations SHOULD use an initial timer value
   of 100 msec (the minimum defined in RFC 6298 [RFC6298]) and double
   the value at each retransmission, up to no less than the RFC 6298
   maximum of 60 seconds.  Note that we recommend a 1-second timer
   rather than the 3-second RFC 6298 default in order to improve latency
   for time-sensitive applications.  Because DTLS only uses
   retransmission for handshake and not dataflow, the effect on
   congestion should be minimal.

   Implementations SHOULD retain the current timer value until a
   transmission without loss occurs, at which time the value may be
   reset to the initial value.  After a long period of idleness, no less
   than 10 times the current timer value, implementations may reset the
   timer to the initial value.  One situation where this might occur is
   when a rehandshake is used after substantial data transfer.

Internet-Draft                     TLS                    September 2016


5.6.  CertificateVerify and Finished Messages

   CertificateVerify and Finished messages have the same format as in
   TLS 1.3.  Hash calculations include entire handshake messages,
   including DTLS-specific fields: message_seq, fragment_offset, and
   fragment_length.  However, in order to remove sensitivity to
   handshake message fragmentation, the CertificateVerify and the
   Finished messages MUST be computed as if each handshake message had
   been sent as a single fragment following the algorithm described in
   Section 4.4.1 and Section 4.4.3 of [TLS13], respectively.

5.7.  Alert Messages

   Note that Alert messages are not retransmitted at all, even when they
   occur in the context of a handshake.  However, a DTLS implementation
   which would ordinarily issue an alert SHOULD generate a new alert
   message if the offending record is received again (e.g., as a
   retransmitted handshake message).  Implementations SHOULD detect when
   a peer is persistently sending bad messages and terminate the local
   connection state after such misbehavior is detected.

5.8.  Establishing New Associations with Existing Parameters

   If a DTLS client-server pair is configured in such a way that
   repeated connections happen on the same host/port quartet, then it is
   possible that a client will silently abandon one connection and then
   initiate another with the same parameters (e.g., after a reboot).
   This will appear to the server as a new handshake with epoch=0.  In
   cases where a server believes it has an existing association on a
   given host/port quartet and it receives an epoch=0 ClientHello, it
   SHOULD proceed with a new handshake but MUST NOT destroy the existing
   association until the client has demonstrated reachability either by
   completing a cookie exchange or by completing a complete handshake
   including delivering a verifiable Finished message.  After a correct
   Finished message is received, the server MUST abandon the previous
   association to avoid confusion between two valid associations with
   overlapping epochs.  The reachability requirement prevents off-path/
   blind attackers from destroying associations merely by sending forged
   ClientHellos.

5.9.  Epoch Values and Rekeying

   A recipient of a DTLS message needs to select the correct keying
   material in order to process an incoming message.  With the
   possibility of message loss and re-order an identifier is needed to
   determine which cipher state has been used to protect the record
   payload.  The epoch value fulfills this role in DTLS.  In addition to
   the key derivation steps described in Section 7 of [TLS13] triggered



Rescorla & Tschofenig     Expires March 9, 2017                [Page 26]

   by the states during the handshake a sender may want to rekey at any
   time during the lifetime of the connection and has to have a way to
   indicate that it is updating its sending cryptographic keys.

   The following epoch values are reserved and correspond to phases in
   the handshake and allow identification of the correct cipher state:

   -  epoch value (0) for use with unencrypted messages, namely
      ClientHello, ServerHello, and HelloRetryRequest.

   -  epoch value (1) for the Finished message protected using the 0-RTT
      handshake key.

   -  epoch value (2) for 0-RTT 'Application Data' protected using keys
      derived from the
      early_traffic_secret.

   -  epoch value (3) for messages protected using keys derived from the
      handshake_traffic_secret, namely the EncryptedExtensions to the
      Finished message sent by the client).

   -  epoch value (4) for application data payloads protected using keys
      derived from the initial traffic_secret_0.

   -  epoch value (5 to 2^16-1) for application data payloads protected
      using keys from the traffic_secret_N (N>0).

   Using these reserved epoch values a receiver knows what cipher state
   has been used to encrypt and integrity protect a message.
   Implementations that receive a payload with an epoch value for which
   no corresponding cipher state can be determined MUST generate a fatal
   "unexpected_message" alert.  For example, client incorrectly uses
   epoch value 5 when sending application data in a 0-RTT exchange with
   the first message.  A server will not be able to compute the
   appropriate keys and will therefore have to respond with a fatal
   alert.

   Increasing the epoch value by a sender (starting with value 5
   upwards) corresponds semantically to rekeying using the KeyUpdate
   message in TLS 1.3.  Instead of utilizing an dedicated message in
   DTLS 1.3 the sender uses an increase in the epoch value to signal
   rekeying.  Hence, a sender that decides to increment the epoch value
   (with value starting at 5) MUST send all its traffic using the next
   generation of keys, computed as described in Section 7.2 of [TLS13].
   Upon receiving a payload with such a new epoch value, the receiver
   MUST update their receiving keys and if they have not already updated
   their sending state up to or past the then current receiving
   generation MUST send messages with the new epoch value prior to

   sending any other messages.  For epoch values lower than 5 the key
   schedule described in Section 7.1 of [TLS13] is applicable.

   Note that epoch values do not wrap.  If a DTLS implementation would
   need to wrap the epoch value, it MUST terminate the connection.

   The traffic key calculation is described in Section 7.3 of [TLS13].

6.  Application Data Protocol

   Application data messages are carried by the record layer and are
   fragmented and encrypted based on the current connection state.  The
   messages are treated as transparent data to the record layer.

7.  Security Considerations

   Security issues are discussed primarily in [TLS13].

   The primary additional security consideration raised by DTLS is that
   of denial of service.  DTLS includes a cookie exchange designed to
   protect against denial of service.  However, implementations that do
   not use this cookie exchange are still vulnerable to DoS.  In
   particular, DTLS servers that do not use the cookie exchange may be
   used as attack amplifiers even if they themselves are not
   experiencing DoS.  Therefore, DTLS servers SHOULD use the cookie
   exchange unless there is good reason to believe that amplification is
   not a threat in their environment.  Clients MUST be prepared to do a
   cookie exchange with every handshake.

   Unlike TLS implementations, DTLS implementations SHOULD NOT respond
   to invalid records by terminating the connection.

8.  Changes to DTLS 1.2

   Since TLS 1.3 introduce a large number of changes to TLS 1.2, the
   list of changes from DTLS 1.2 to DTLS 1.3 is equally large.  For this
   reason this section focuses on the most important changes only.

   -  New handshake pattern, which leads to a shorter message exchange

   -  Support for AEAD-only ciphers

   -  HelloRetryRequest of TLS 1.3 used instead of HelloVerifyRequest

   -  More flexible ciphersuite negotiation

   -  New session resumption mechanism

      Handshake.message_seq) when 0-RTT is rejected.  Proposal: keep
      pushing the numbers forward

   -  Explore whether the record layer header can be simplified (to 2
      octets for epoch & sequence number)

   -  Do we need the HelloRequest message in DTLS 1.3?

   -  Use ACK message to simplify the retransmission state machine.

   -  Document the hash exporting hack that makes HRR stateless.

   -  Update text in the appendix regarding backwards compatibility.
