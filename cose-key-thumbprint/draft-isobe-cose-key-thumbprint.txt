                   draft-isobe-cose-key-thumbprint-00

Abstract

   This specification defines a method for computing a hash value over a
   COSE Key. It defines which fields in a COSE Key structure are used in
   the hash computation, the method of creating a canonical form of the
   fields, and how to hash the byte sequence.  The resulting hash value
   can be used for identifying or selecting a key that is the subject of
   the thumbprint.

1.  Introduction

   This specification defines a method for computing a hash value
   (a.k.a. digest) over a COSE Key structure [RFC9052].  It defines
   which fields in a COSE Key structure are used in the hash
   computation, the method of creating a canonical form for those
   fields, and how to hash the byte sequence.  The resulting hash value
   can be used for identifying or selecting the key that is the subject
   of the thumbprint, for instance, by using the COSE Key Thumbprint
   value as a "kid" (key ID) value.

   This specification only defines how thumbprints of public keys are
   created, not private keys or symmetric keys.

Internet-Draft   COSE Key Thumbprint and Thumbprint URI         May 2023


   A future version of this document will describe the concept of a COSE
   Key Thumbprint URI.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  COSE Key Thumbprint

   The thumbprint of a COSE Key MUST be computed as follows:

   1.  Construct a COSE_Key structure (see Section 7 of [RFC9052])
       containing only the required elements representing the key.  This
       specification describes what those required elements are and
       what, if necessary, what the unique encoding is.

   2.  Sort the required elements based on the deterministic format
       described in Section 4.2.1 of [RFC8949].

   3.  Hash the bytes of the resulting COSE_Key structure from step (2)
       with a cryptographic hash function H.  For example, SHA-256
       [RFC6234] may be used as a hash function.

   The resulting value is the COSE Key Thumbprint with H of the COSE
   Key.  The details of this computation are further described in
   subsequent sections.

4.  Required COSE Key Elements

   Only the required elements of a key's representation are used when
   computing its COSE Key Thumbprint value.  This section summarizes the
   required elements.

   The "kty" (label: 1) element MUST be present for all key types and
   the integer value found in the IANA COSE Key Types registry MUST be
   used.  Other elements depend on the chosen key type.  The subsection
   below list the required elements for commonly used key types.

4.1.  RSA Public Keys

   The required elements for an RSA public key are:

   *  "n" (label: -1, data type: bstr)




Isobe & Tschofenig      Expires 12 November 2023                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft   COSE Key Thumbprint and Thumbprint URI         May 2023


   *  "e" (label: -2, data type: bstr)

4.2.  Elliptic Curve Public Keys

   The required elements for an elliptic curve public key are:

   *  "crv" (label: -1, data type: int)

   *  "x" (label: -2, data type: bstr)

   *  "y" (label: -3, data type: bstr)

   Note: [RFC9052] offers both compressed as well as uncompressed point
   representations.  For interoperability, implementations following
   this specification MUST use the uncompressed point representation.
   Hence, the y-coordinate is expressed as a bstr.  An implementation
   that uses the compressed point representation MUST compute the
   uncompressed representation for the purpose of the thumbprint
   calculation.

4.3.  Others

   As other key type values are defined, the specifications defining
   them should be similarly consulted to determine which elements, in
   addition to the "kty" element, are required.

4.4.  Why Not Include Optional COSE Key Elements?

   Optional elements of COSE Keys are intentionally not included in the
   COSE Key Thumbprint computation so that their absence or presence in
   the COSE Key does not alter the resulting value.  The COSE Key
   Thumbprint value is a digest of the elements required to represent
   the key as a COSE Key -- not of additional data that may also
   accompany the key.

   Optional elements are not included so that the COSE Key Thumbprint
   refers to a key -- not a key with an associated set of key
   attributes.  Different application contexts might or might not
   include different subsets of optional attributes about the key in the
   COSE Key structure.  If these were included in the calculation of the
   COSE Key Thumbprint, the values would be different for those COSE
   Keys, even though the keys are the same.  The benefit of including
   only the required elements is that the COSE Key Thumbprint of any
   COSE Key representing the key remains the same, regardless of any
   other attributes that are present.

Internet-Draft   COSE Key Thumbprint and Thumbprint URI         May 2023


   Different kinds of thumbprints could be defined by other
   specifications that might include some or all additional COSE Key
   elements, if use cases arise where such different kinds of
   thumbprints would be useful.

4.5.  Selection of Hash Function

   A specific hash function must be chosen by an application to compute
   the hash value of the hash input.  For example, SHA-256 [RFC6234]
   might be used as the hash function by the application.  While SHA-256
   is a good default choice at the time of writing, the hash function of
   choice can be expected to change over time as the cryptographic
   landscape evolves.

   Note that in many cases, only the party that creates a key will need
   to know the hash function used.  A typical usage is for the producer
   of the key to use the thumbprint value as a "kid" (key ID) value.  In
   this case, the consumer of the "kid" treats it as an opaque value
   that it uses to select the key.

   However, in some cases, multiple parties will be reproducing the COSE
   Key Thumbprint calculation and comparing the results.  In these
   cases, the parties will need to know which hash function was used and
   use the same one.

4.6.  Relationship to Digests of X.509 Values

   COSE Key Thumbprint values are computed on the COSE Key element
   required to represent a key, rather than all members of a COSE Key
   that the key is represented in.  Thus, they are more analogous to
   applications that use digests of X.509 Subject Public Key Info (SPKI)
   values, which are defined in Section 4.1.2.7 of [RFC5280], than to
   applications that use digests of complete certificate values, as the
   "x5t" (X.509 certificate SHA-1 thumbprint) [RFC9360] value defined
   for X.509 certificate objects does.  While logically equivalent to a
   digest of the SPKI representation of the key, a COSE Key Thumbprint
   is computed over the CBOR representation of that key, rather than
   over an ASN.1 representation of it.

5.  Example

   This section demonstrates the COSE Key Thumbprint computation for the
   following example COSE Key containing an ECC public key.

   For better readability, the example is first presented in JSON (with
   the long line broken for display purposes only).

       / kid /
       2:'meriadoc.brandybuck@buckland.example'
     }

   The example above corresponds to the following CBOR encoding (with
   link breaks added for display purposes only):

   16E642E6578616D706C65

   Not all of the elements from the example above are used in the COSE
   Key Thumbprint since the required elements of an elliptic curve
   public key are:

   *  "kty"

   *  "crv"

   *  "x"

   *  "y"

   The required order based on Section 4.2.1 of [RFC8949] is:

   *  "y" (label: -3, data type: bstr)

   *  "x" (label: -2, data type: bstr)

   *  "crv" (label: -1, data type: int)

   *  "kty" (label: 1, data type: int)

   The resulting COSE Key structure, in CBOR diagnostic format with
   line-breaks added for better readability, with the minimum elements
   in the correct order are.

   In CBOR encoding the result is (with line-breaks added for display

   CA7CA7E9EECD0084D19C

   Using SHA-256, the resulting thumbprint is:

   496bd8afadf307e5b08c64b0421bf9dc01528a344a43bda88fadd1669da253ec

6.  Security Considerations

   A COSE Key Thumbprint will only uniquely identify a particular key if
   a single unambiguous COSE Key representation for that key is defined
   and used when computing the COSE Key Thumbprint.

   If two asymmetric keys are used by different parties with different
   key identifiers then the COSE Key Thumbprints will still be equal
   since the key identifier itself is not included in the thumbprint
   calculation (similarly to other optional elements in the COSE_Key
   structure).  When the inclusion of certain optinal elements in the
   thumbprint calcuation is important for a given application, this
   specification is not the appropriate choice.

   Even more insidious is that an attacker may supply a key that is a
   transformation of a legal key in order to have it appear to be a
   different key.  For instance, if a legitimate RSA key uses a modulus
   value N and an attacker supplies a key with modulus 3*N, the modified
   key would still work about 1/3 of the time, but would appear to be a
   different key.  Thus, while thumbprint values are valuable for
   identifying legitimate keys, comparing thumbprint values is not a
   reliable means of excluding (blacklisting) the use of particular keys
   (or transformations thereof).

7.  IANA Considerations

   There are no actions for IANA.
