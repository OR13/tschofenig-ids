 Key IDs in Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Datagram Transport Layer

Abstract

   In TLS handshakes, certificates often take up the majority of the
   bytes transmitted.

   This document describes how the size of certificate transmissions can
   be reduced by utilizing key ids.  This approach is useful when
   certificates and certificate chains have been pre-provisioned out-of-
   band between clients and servers.

1.  Introduction

   When TLS is used with certificate-based authentication then the
   exchanged certificates, particularly when mutual certificate-based
   authentication is used, requires a fair amount of bandwidth.  In
   certain deployment situations these certificates do, however, not
   need to be exchanged with every handshake because they rarely change
   or are known in advance by the communication partners.

   In order to reduce latency and over-the-wire/over-the-air overhead it
   can be useful to reduce the amount of data exchanged during a TLS
   handshake.

   There have been prior attempts to reduce the certificate overhead,
   namely

   -  TLS Cached Info [RFC7924] describes a mechanism that allows a
      client and a server to avoid transmitting certificates already
      shared in an earlier handshake.

   -  Certificate compression [I-D.ietf-tls-certificate-compression]
      specifies a mechanism to compress certificates using zlib, brotli
      and zstd.

   -  Various specifications have defined alternative certificate
      formats for use in TLS.  For example, [I-D.tschofenig-tls-cwt]
      defines how to use a CBOR Web Token (CWT) in TLS as an alternative
      to an X.5090-based certificate.

   This document describes a mechanism that allows certificates to be
   referenced using a key id.

2.  Conventions and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
   2119 [RFC2119].

3.  The CWT Certificate Type

   This document defines a new value to the "TLS Certificate Types" sub-
   registry and the value is defined as follows.

                  };

                Extension extensions<0..2^16-1>;
         } CertificateEntry;

   The varint type is defined in [I-D.rescorla-tls-ctls].

4.  Security and Privacy Considerations

   The transmission of key ids instead of certificates provides benefits
   by lowering the over-the-air transmission overhead since key ids are
   significantly smaller than entire certificates.

   This document does not mandate the size of the key ids.  A possible
   construction is to use a SHA256 hash and truncate it to 64 bits.

   While out-of-band configuration of certificates and key ids are not
   are not suitable for a generic Web-based environment, key ids are a

   reasonable approach for many Internet of Things deployments where
   there is a close relationship between the software running on the
   device and the server-side communication endpoint.

   When Key IDs are used with TLS 1.3 [RFC8446] and DTLS 1.3
   [I-D.ietf-tls-dtls13] additional privacy properties are provided
   since most handshake messages are encrypted.  Hence, Key IDs used in
   version 1.3 provide better privacy benefits than in version 1.2.

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to add a new value to the "TLS Certificate Types"
   sub-registry for Key IDs.
